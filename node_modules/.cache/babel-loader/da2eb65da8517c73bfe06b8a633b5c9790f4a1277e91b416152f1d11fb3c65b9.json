The foundry behemoths’ fourth-quarter net profit soared 57% to $374.68 billion from a year earlier, driven by a surge in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chipsets.\\n\\nBut it’s not the latest quarterly result that propelled its shares higher. The TSMC stock has already gained 91% in the past year with the advent of AI. However, can the TSMC stock sustain this growth and remain a good buy? Let’s see –\\n\\n3 Reasons to be Bullish on TSMC Stock\\n\\nWhile the current quarterly results have boosted the TSMC stock, the long-term growth trajectory depends on the long-term growth prospects. TSMC’s first-quarter revenue guidance of $25 billion to $25.8 billion is 6% higher than expectations, suggesting strong near-term growth. Also, management expects a 20% revenue CAGR over the next five-year period, driven by growth opportunities in AI, 5G smartphones, and high-performance computing.\\n\\nThe rising demand for TSMC’s custom AI chips from Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL has strengthened its future growth. Meanwhile, Apple Inc. AAPL has witnessed a rise in demand for its smartphones that require TSMC’s chips, a positive development for the latter. TSMC’s bright future is also due to the forthcoming launch of their highly efficient 2-nanometer (nm) chips this year, with pre-order demand exceeding 3 and 5nm.\\n\\nTSMC’s dominant position in the global foundry market means the stock is well-poised to take advantage of the growing opportunities. After all, the semiconductor market worldwide is projected to generate $1.47 trillion in revenues in 2030 from $729 billion in 2022, per SNS Insider. Management mentioned that the U.S. government’s curb on chip sales to China is “manageable.”\\n\\nSecond, the new Stargate AI infrastructure program is expected to be a game changer for the TSMC stock. President Trump intends to allocate $500 billion for AI infrastructure, boosting AI stocks. TSMC stands to benefit as its advanced chips are essential for operating AI data centers.\\n\\nThird, the TSMC stock is likely to rise because the company generates profits efficiently, with a net profit margin of 40.52%, slightly more than the Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry’s 40.51%, indicating a high margin.\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nConsider Buying TSMC Stock\\n\\nWith the TSMC stock poised to gain in the long term due to multiple growth opportunities, a new Stargate AI infrastructure project, and strong fundamentals, it is judicious for investors to place their bets on the stock now. Brokers also expect the TSMC stock to rise and have raised its average short-term price target by 7.5% to $235.13 from the previous $218.70. The highest short-term price target is $265, indicating an upside of 21.2%.\",\n  \"published_date\": \"2025-01-23T12:05:00.000Z\",\n  \"title\": \"3 Reasons to Buy TSMC Stock Beyond Record Q4 Net Profit - Yahoo Finance\",\n  \"url\": \"https:\\/\\/finance.yahoo.com\\/news\\/3-reasons-buy-tsmc-stock-200500471.html\",\n  \"entities\": \"{\\\"entities\\\": [\\\"TSMC\\\"]}\",\n  \"sentiment\": null\n}, {\n  \"id\": 137,\n  \"publisher\": \"Arizona Big Media\",\n  \"description\": \"Reinforcing a commitment to invest locally in new pathways into the semiconductor industry, today TSMC Arizona was joined by Governor Katie Hobbs and Mayor Kate Gallego to announce the expansion of its Registered Technician Apprenticeship program, offering a road to new jobs.

Our first-of-its kind program for semiconductor technicians represents what’s possible when government, industry and education come together,” said Rose Castaneres, president of TSMC Arizona. “We are deeply committed to creating job opportunities for local Arizonans. Our newest technician apprentices will get the support and training they need to thrive in their new careers, and help us make the most advanced semiconductor technology in the United States.”\\n\\n“The semiconductor industry has created opportunities for countless Arizonans to gain access to good-paying, stable jobs,” said Governor Katie Hobbs. “Today, we are making that opportunity more accessible by creating new pathways into this growing, high-tech sector through robust new apprenticeship programs. With strong partners like TSMC, Arizona has been a leader in synchronizing our workforce efforts and investing in training that meets private sector needs and target key industries powering our economy, and today’s announcement is a continuation of our commitment to connecting Arizonans to the jobs of the future.”\\n\\n“Today’s announcement is a significant step forward in our commitment to invest in our residents and create new, high-wage career pathways into Arizona’s growing semiconductor industry.

However, the earthquake might still cause an estimated 30-40% impact on equipment, with over 25,000 to 30,000 wafers reportedly damaged.\\n\\nOn the other hand, TSMC’s Fab 14 might not be as fortunate, as it is an older facility producing mature nodes. According to Liberty Times, supply chain sources estimate that around half of the equipment in the fab was affected, with over 30,000 wafers from Fab 14A and 14B rendered unusable.\\n\\nThe Commercial Times suggests that in the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in April 2024, TSMC reported earthquake-related losses of only NT$3 billion (USD 91.6 million), which affected its Q2 gross margin by approximately 0.5 percentage points. In comparison, the financial impact of this recent earthquake is expected to be manageable, the report adds.\\n\\nTrendForce notes that TSMC operates an 8-inch fab and two 12-inch fabs in Tainan, producing a wide range of technologies from mature nodes to advanced 5\\/4nm and 3nm processes.\\n\\nAccording to TrendForce, while the Tainan fabs produce a diverse range of products, the overall utilization rate for mature processes is currently at 70–80%, reflecting the seasonal lull in component demand. This provides significant flexibility for production adjustments. For advanced nodes, TrendForce believes most current wafer starts are for inventory preparation, and the short downtime or minor debris impact can be easily mitigated. As a result, no significant disruptions are anticipated.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n[News] 6.4 Magnitude Earthquake Hits Southern Taiwan, TSMC Evacuates Factories, Impact Under Review\\n\\n(Photo credit: TSMC)\",\n  \"published_date\": \"2025-01-23T18:36:00.000Z\",\n  \"title\": \"[News] TSMC Reportedly Expects Fab 18 Recovery by Jan. 23, Fab 14 Timeline Uncertain After 6.4 Earthquake - TrendForce\",\n  \"url\": \"https:\\/\\/www.trendforce.com\\/news\\/2025\\/01\\/24\\/news-tsmc-reportedly-expects-fab-18-recovery-by-jan-23-fab-14-timeline-uncertain-after-6-4-magnitude-earthquake\\/\",\n  \"entities\": \"{\\\"entities\\\": [\\\"TSMC\\\"]}\",\n  \"sentiment\": null\n}, {\n  \"id\": 140,\n  \"publisher\": \"DIGITIMES\",\n  \"description\": \"Save my User ID and Password\\n\\nSome subscribers prefer to save their log-in information so they do not have to enter their User ID and Password each time they visit the site.

Our newest technician apprentices will get the support and training they need to thrive in their new careers, and help us make the most advanced semiconductor technology in the United States.”\\n\\n“The semiconductor industry has created opportunities for countless Arizonans to gain access to good-paying, stable jobs,” said Governor Katie Hobbs. “Today, we are making that opportunity more accessible by creating new pathways into this growing, high-tech sector through robust new apprenticeship programs. With strong partners like TSMC, Arizona has been a leader in synchronizing our workforce efforts and investing in training that meets private sector needs and target key industries powering our economy, and today’s announcement is a continuation of our commitment to connecting Arizonans to the jobs of the future.”\\n\\n“Today’s announcement is a significant step forward in our commitment to invest in our residents and create new, high-wage career pathways into Arizona’s growing semiconductor industry. By expanding the registered apprenticeship program and adding even more opportunities for training, TSMC is helping to build and upskill the strong workforce it needs to continue making the cutting-edge chips that power virtually every piece of technology in the modern world. The City of Phoenix is proud to support TSMC in building off our existing partnership to ensure Phoenicians have access to top-tier instruction and rewarding jobs,” said Mayor Kate Gallego.\\n\\nEarlier this year, TSMC Arizona unveiled a first-of-its-kind semiconductor-industry focused Registered Technician Apprenticeship for Facilities Technicians. This program was sponsored by the City of Phoenix, and supported with classroom curriculum co-developed with Maricopa Community Colleges. The first cohort started as TSMC Arizona full time employees in April, and are now earning their on-the-job training hours, and attending courses at Estrella Mountain Community College. The estimated time to complete an apprenticeship is 18-24 months, with opportunities to pursue stackable credentials and an optional associates degree.\\n\\nTSMC Arizona is investing more than $5M in this program representing on-the-job training hours and education tuition support for its apprentice employees as they earn their apprenticeships or “journeyman cards.” The program is also supported by the City of Phoenix and the Arizona Commerce Authority. This effort is also backed by the Department of Commerce as part of the CHIPS Act funding incentive program to mobilize the regional workforce for large-scale semiconductor investments.\\n\\nOnce all three TSMC Arizona advanced-manufacturing fabs are fully operational in Phoenix, its local workforce will near 6000, which will include thousands of technicians. TSMC Arizona is partnering with these educational institutions now to recruit and hire more nearly 130 new apprentices and trainees in 2025. This is in addition to the hundreds of open positions for its Phoenix operation.\",\r\n\t\t\"published_date\" : \"2025-01-23T04:10:30.000Z\",\r\n\t\t\"title\" : \"TSMC Arizona offers new jobs via Technician Apprentice Program - Arizona Big Media\",\r\n\t\t\"url\" : \"https:\\/\\/azbigmedia.com\\/business\\/tsmc-arizona-offers-new-jobs-via-technician-apprentice-program\\/\",\r\n\t\t\"entities\" : \"{\\\"entities\\\": [\\\"TSMC\\\"]}\",\r\n\t\t\"sentiment\" : null\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"id\" : 138,\r\n\t\t\"publisher\" : \"AOL\",\r\n\t\t\"description\" : \"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Chipmaker TSMC said on Tuesday that all its sites were operating following an overnight 6.4 magnitude earthquake in southern Taiwan that was centred on a mountainous rural area and caused only minor damage and light injuries.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the dominant maker of advanced chips and a major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia said it had evacuated workers at some sites in central and southern Taiwan as a precaution after the quake, which hit shortly past midnight on Tuesday.\\n\\n\\\"Post-earthquake structural inspections have been completed at all sites, confirming that the structures are safe and operations are gradually resuming,\\\" it said in an emailed statement.\\n\\n\\\"Currently, the water supply, power, and workplace safety systems are functioning normally and all TSMC's sites are operating.

However, the earthquake might still cause an estimated 30-40% impact on equipment, with over 25,000 to 30,000 wafers reportedly damaged.\\n\\nOn the other hand, TSMC’s Fab 14 might not be as fortunate, as it is an older facility producing mature nodes. According to Liberty Times, supply chain sources estimate that around half of the equipment in the fab was affected, with over 30,000 wafers from Fab 14A and 14B rendered unusable.\\n\\nThe Commercial Times suggests that in the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in April 2024, TSMC reported earthquake-related losses of only NT$3 billion (USD 91.6 million), which affected its Q2 gross margin by approximately 0.5 percentage points. In comparison, the financial impact of this recent earthquake is expected to be manageable, the report adds.\\n\\nTrendForce notes that TSMC operates an 8-inch fab and two 12-inch fabs in Tainan, producing a wide range of technologies from mature nodes to advanced 5\\/4nm and 3nm processes.\\n\\nAccording to TrendForce, while the Tainan fabs produce a diverse range of products, the overall utilization rate for mature processes is currently at 70–80%, reflecting the seasonal lull in component demand. This provides significant flexibility for production adjustments. For advanced nodes, TrendForce believes most current wafer starts are for inventory preparation, and the short downtime or minor debris impact can be easily mitigated. As a result, no significant disruptions are anticipated.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n[News] 6.4 Magnitude Earthquake Hits Southern Taiwan, TSMC Evacuates Factories, Impact Under Review\\n\\n(Photo credit: TSMC)\",\r\n\t\t\"published_date\" : \"2025-01-23T18:36:00.000Z\",\r\n\t\t\"title\" : \"[News] TSMC Reportedly Expects Fab 18 Recovery by Jan. 23, Fab 14 Timeline Uncertain After 6.4 Earthquake - TrendForce\",\r\n\t\t\"url\" : \"https:\\/\\/www.trendforce.com\\/news\\/2025\\/01\\/24\\/news-tsmc-reportedly-expects-fab-18-recovery-by-jan-23-fab-14-timeline-uncertain-after-6-4-magnitude-earthquake\\/\",\r\n\t\t\"entities\" : \"{\\\"entities\\\": [\\\"TSMC\\\"]}\",\r\n\t\t\"sentiment\" : null\r\n\t},\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t\"id\" : 140,\r\n\t\t\"publisher\" : \"DIGITIMES\",\r\n\t\t\"description\" : \"Save my User ID and Password\\n\\nSome subscribers prefer to save their log-in information so they do not have to enter their User ID and Password each time they visit the site.
