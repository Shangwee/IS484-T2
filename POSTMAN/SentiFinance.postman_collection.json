Musk previously predicted in 2019 that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Musk has been promising autonomous Teslas for a decade.\\n\\nIf successful, Musk’s latest prediction could mark a massive pivot for the EV maker from generating most of its revenue from vehicle sales to becoming the world’s largest robotaxi service. Musk has said autonomous vehicles will generate vastly more revenue and profits for Tesla than selling nonautonomous vehicles to consumers.\\n\\n“This is not some far-off mythical situation,” Musk told investors and analysts. “It’s literally five to six months away.”\\n\\nElon Musk’s great expectations\\n\\nHe said 2025 would be Tesla’s most important year, 2026 would be “epic,” and 2027 and 2028 would be “ridiculously good.” Musk also predicted Tesla could be making 100 million humanoid robots within a few years. The Optimus robots use a version of Full Self-Driving software.\\n\\nAfter testing its first robotaxi service in Austin this summer, Tesla plans to expand the network to major U.S. markets, including in California, by the end of the year, Musk said. Europe and China, which have more difficult regulatory regimes than the U.S., could see autonomous Teslas by the end of 2026, he added.\\n\\n“We’re looking for a safety level that is significantly above the average human driver,” Musk said Jan. 29. “The standard has to be very high because the moment there is any kind of accident with an autonomous vehicle, that’s immediately worldwide headlines.”\\n\\nIn its fourth-quarter earnings report Jan. 29, Tesla said fourth-quarter net income fell 71 percent to $2.3 billion and its gross margin was impacted by sales incentives and discounts. Most of the net income decline came from a $5.9 billion one-time noncash tax benefit in fourth-quarter 2023, making for an unfavorable comparison.\",\n            \"entities\": [\n                \"Tesla\"\n            ],\n            \"id\": 1,\n            \"published_date\": \"Thu, 30 Jan 2025 19:26:44 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": \"Automotive News\",\n            \"score\": null,\n            \"sentiment\": \"\",\n            \"summary\": \"Tesla Inc. will finally launch a long-promised commercial robotaxi service in June — starting in Austin, Texas — before expanding the ride-hailing network across the U.S. and globally, CEO Elon Musk told investors Jan. 29.\\n“So, we’re going to be launching unsupervised Full Self-Driving as a paid service in Austin in June.” In its financial report, Tesla said fourth-quarter profit fell, but revenue rose slightly.\\nIf successful, Musk’s latest prediction could mark a massive pivot for the EV maker from generating most of its revenue from vehicle sales to becoming the world’s largest robotaxi service.\\nAfter testing its first robotaxi service in Austin this summer, Tesla plans to expand the network to major U.S. markets, including in California, by the end of the year, Musk said.\\n“We’re looking for a safety level that is significantly above the average human driver,” Musk said Jan. 29.\",\n            \"title\": \"Tesla plans paid robotaxi service in Austin in June, CEO Elon Musk says\",\n            \"url\": \"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-plans-paid-robotaxi-austin-112644208.html\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Sign in to access your portfolio\\n\\nSign in\",\n            \"entities\": [\n                \"Tesla\"\n            ],\n            \"id\": 2,\n            \"published_date\": \"Thu, 30 Jan 2025 18:22:31 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": \"Bloomberg\",\n            \"score\": null,\n            \"sentiment\": \"\",\n            \"summary\": \"Sign in to access your portfolio Sign in\",\n            \"title\": \"Tesla Buoys Investors With Growth Pledge, Robotaxi Rollout\",\n            \"url\": \"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-buoys-investors-growth-pledge-102231980.html\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"description\": \"On Wednesday Afternoon, Tesla (TSLA, Financial) shares bumped up and down after a mixed fourth-quarter earnings report from the company.

Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.73, down from the expected $0.77. The 2024 results came in below what company executives had forecasted for the year, expecting in a letter that full-year net income would total $8.4 billion, a drop of 23% from 2023 and 40% down from the year-earlier peak of $14.1 billion.\\n\\nTesla pointed towards the dark, as it forecasted a return to vehicle growth in 2025 but lost ground on a key profit metric. Next year, production of its autonomous 'Cybercab' taxi is due to start, as well as cheaper new models in 2025.\\n\\nEnthusiasm for advances in AI, as well as the tailwinds of regulations following Donald Trump's election victory, still buoyed Tesla stock up by over 100% in the past 12 months.

The US stock market has struggled, facing increased volatility and concern throughout the year so far. There is no shortage of companies that have seen their share price fall, with talk of a trade war abounding. However, several analysts project stock to rise.\\n\\nIndeed, while many companies, especially in automotive, have suffered amid the tariff talks, Tesla builds all the cars it sells in the United States in California and Texas. Tesla has built largely self-sufficient supply chains in the United States and China, a rarity in a world of interconnected trade. As a result, the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods, and the continuing threat to put them on Mexican and Canadian products, might help Tesla by hurting its competitors more.\\n\\nThe EV manufacturer is one of the hardest hit stocks of the year, with its price on a major downfall. Although there remains a lot of potential in the robotics and autonomous driving sectors, that has yet to pay off in the near term. Fortunately, there are rumours that the tariffs wouldn’t affect Tesla’s sales at all, especially as the United States eyes a deal with India, Tesla’s newest market. Therefore, the Elon Musk-led EV maker might get a slight boost as the tariffs affect its competition.\\n\\nTrump Administration’s Recent Moves Benefit Elon Musk and Tesla\\n\\nFurthermore, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate financial support for the construction of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles. This move could halt companies seeking to compete with Tesla’s extensive network, another boost for the EV maker. Trump is also attempting to cut or eliminate loans and subsidies that competitors like Ford Motor and Rivian are using to finance electric vehicle and battery factories. The moves are almost pouring into Elon Musk’s favor, although the Tesla co-founder has reportedly said nothing about trade or EV sales since joining Trump’s D.O.G.E. team.\\n\\nTD Cowen projects Tesla (TSLA) to surge 45% despite its 2025 slide so far. The firm upgraded its price target for Tesla to $388, implying a 47% upside, according to a report. Although there is growing concern, analyst Itay Micchale shared his optimism with the stock. “While we are valuation-/sentiment-minded when recommending stocks, we agree with the underlying notion that Tesla cannot be compared to other automaker stocks, not because it isn’t an ‘auto company’ but because its arguably best positioned to capture sizable opportunities that exist across auto-mobility and adjacent markets,” he said.\\n\\nThere is no shortage of analysts who echo that sentiment. Despite falling 27% in the last month, it has a $393 median target. That would represent a 50% increase. However, of the 57 analysts surveyed by , 23% have a sell rating on the stock. Compared, just 47% have issued a buy rating.\",\n                \"entities\": [\n                    \"TSLA\"\n                ],\n                \"id\": 443,\n                \"published_date\": \"Mon, 10 Mar 2025 20:31:43 GMT\",\n                \"publisher\": \"Watcher Guru\",\n                \"score\": 0.9999815225601196,\n                \"sentiment\": \"Positive\",\n                \"summary\": \"Despite the US-China trade war impacting many companies, Tesla's US-based manufacturing and self-sufficient supply chains may give it an advantage.

It was the biggest fall for Tesla since the 2020 pandemic.\\n\\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 4% in its worst day since 2022, as the “Magnificent Seven” stocks led the sell-off. Tesla’s (TSLA) rout continued, plunging 15% and officially wiping out the gains it had made in the wake of Trump’s election win. Furthermore, all three major indexes built on losses of more than 2% last week as the Nasdaq plummeted deeper into correction territory.\\n\\nAnalysts Suggest Further Losses for Tesla\\n\\nAnalysts are also projecting a cutback in numbers for Tesla, which also could tank its stock value more. UBS Group AG’s Joseph Spak cut delivery projections both for the first quarter and the full year. Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo similarly lowered his estimates for Tesla deliveries on March 6. UBS now expects the company to deliver 367,000 cars in the first quarter, down from the 437,000 it said it had “plugged in as a placeholder” after Tesla’s fourth quarter results in late January.\\n\\nMoreover, as its European sales have been decimated, Tesla is looking for any signs of a rebound. Tesla stock was also pressured by news that shipments in China fell 49% from last year in February to the lowest level in almost three years. The current stock market crisis appears bearish for the company’s future. There is still room to turn things around, despite Telsa (TSLA) dropping 27% in February.

According to Bloomberg, Musk’s net worth has plunged by over $132 billion this year to $301 billion.\\n\\nDonald Trump to the rescue?\\n\\nCopy link to section\\n\\nThe ongoing Tesla stock crash has attracted the attention of Donald Trump.

He added that he would buy a brand new Tesla vehicle on Tuesday as a sign of :\\n\\n“I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American. Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN?”\\n\\nTesla has become a collateral damage to Donald Trump’s presidency as many liberals have continued to avoid the vehicles.\\n\\nFurther, some Canadian politicians, including Chrystia Freeland, have advocated for charging a 100% tariff on Tesla. The argument is that such a tariff will make Teslas unaffordable in Canada, hurting Musk personally.\\n\\nRead more: Tesla stock price forecast: 4 reasons TSLA is imploding\\n\\nThere are also signs that Musk’s close relationship with Trump is affecting its sales in Europe. Recent data shows that Tesla sales in Europehave plunged by over 40%, a trend that may continue in the coming months.\\n\\nChina may also decide to target Tesla as its trade war with the US gains steam. It can do that by excluding Tesla vehicles from the subsidies that it offers other local EV companies like Li Auto, Xpeng, and BYD.\\n\\nTSLA’s fundamentals and valuation\\n\\nCopy link to section\\n\\nThe ongoing Tesla stock plunge is because of its fairly weak fundamentals. At its peak earlier this year, Tesla had a market cap of over $1.56 trillion.\\n\\nFor a company richly valued like that, you would expect its revenue and profitability growth to be surging.\\n\\nTesla is not doing that as its growth trajectory has faded. Its annual revenue in 2024 rose to $97.6 million, slightly up from the $96.7 million it made a year earlier. Analysts anticipate that Tesla’s sales will be $111 billion this year, which may be too ambitious.\\n\\nTesla deserved a premium valuation during its peak as it was largely the only game in town. Today, many other EV companies are having spectacular growth. In China, BYD has taken a substantial market share. Other companies like Li Auto, XPeng, and Nio are all gaining market share.\\n\\nTesla is pegging its hope on its robotaxi business. While this is a huge market, it will likely take time for the company to be highly profitable in it.\\n\\nTesla stock price analysis\\n\\nCopy link to section\\n\\nThe weekly chart shows that the TSLA share price peaked at $488.55 in January and has now imploded to $222.15. It has retreated below the key support level at $297.97, the highest swing in July 2023.\\n\\nThe stock has also tumbled below the major S/R level of the Murrey Math Lines, a sign that bears are in control. All oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have all pointed downwards.\\n\\nTherefore, the Tesla stock price will likely keep falling despite Donald Trump coming to the rescue. Such a move will see it drop to the next support at $101.18, its lowest point in 2022.\",\n                \"entities\": [\n                    \"TSLA\"\n                ],\n                \"id\": 445,\n                \"published_date\": \"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 06:11:15 GMT\",\n                \"publisher\": \"Invezz\",\n                \"score\": -0.9999990463256836,\n                \"sentiment\": \"Negative\",\n                \"summary\": \"Tesla's stock price has plummeted over 55% this year, reducing its market cap from $1.57 trillion to $660 billion.

Nvidia stock is now down roughly 20% across 2025's trading.\\n\\nHowever, there is a silver lining for Nvidia today\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) published its February sales update this morning, reporting sales of roughly $7.91 billion for the period. While the performance marked an 11.3% sequential decline from January's sales, it was also up 43.1% year over year. TSMC's sales are now up 39.2% year over year across the first two months of this year.\\n\\nTSMC is the leading manufacturer of AI chips and other high-performance semiconductors, and it handles the chip fabrication for the key chips in Nvidia's advanced processors. This means strong performance for TSMC is a bullish indicator for Nvidia.\\n\\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\\n\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is taking heat week after week from one of its most outspoken investors. Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, came out swinging after the company reported weak sales in first quarter for some of its high-end electric vehicles.\\n\\nSales Dip Adds Fuel to the Fire\\n\\n“These numbers suck,” Gerber wrote on X, referring to Tesla's Cybertruck, Model S and Model X, which he says sold just 12,881 units—down 25% from the 17,027 sold in the same period last year. “The high-end EV business has totally eroded. The Cybertruck is basically not selling. The brand is broken and may not be fixable.”\\n\\nDon't Miss:\\n\\nHasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — .\\n\\nInspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets –\\n\\nCalls for Leadership Change\\n\\nGerber pinned the blame squarely on Tesla's board: “The BOD is 100% responsible and should be removed for negligence,” he said.\\n\\nHis frustration isn't new, but it appears to be intensifying. In a recent CNN , Gerber said, “There isn't more that Elon could do to turn off customers from Tesla. I really don't think there's more he could do to turn off customers from Tesla. I really don't think there's more he could do.”\\n\\nHe also criticized Musk’s growing political presence, including his involvement in President Donald Trump's administration. Gerber suggested that Musk is more focused on his government role than on running Tesla.\\n\\n“If he's going to work in the government, I'm all for it,” Gerber said. “But then why isn't somebody else running Tesla?”\\n\\nTrending:\\n\\nMarketing Crisis and Brand Damage\\n\\nGerber said Tesla's biggest issue now isn't just about operations. “It's the image and marketing problem that the company now has, which in my mind is in a crisis at this point.”\\n\\nHe pointed to incidents like as signs of a brand in serious trouble. “Literally terrorist attacks on Tesla showrooms. People burning the most environmentally friendly vehicle ever made.”\\n\\nEven the much-hyped Cybertruck, once marketed as bulletproof and indestructible, , including one over panels that can peel off while driving.\\n\\nCriticism of Robyn Denholm\\n\\nGerber also blasted Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm, accusing her of failing to act in the interest of shareholders. “Robyn Denholm is the woman paid off to do NOTHING to protect the 83% of Tesla investors she is negligently representing. She only represents one shareholder, Musk,” he on X last month.\\n\\nSee Also:\\n\\nSince joining Tesla's board in 2014, Denholm has in cash and stock, according to a Reuters . She has already sold about $532 million worth of Tesla shares, some as recently as early March, right before Tesla's stock plunged.\\n\\nA Delaware judge recently criticized her for approving Musk’s record-setting $56 billion pay package, writing that “outsized director compensation can compromise independence.”\\n\\nCan Tesla Bounce Back?\\n\\nTesla reported its in 2024, and its stock has dropped more than 29% year-to-date, at the time of writing. While Musk has promised to double U.S. vehicle production over the next two years, many investors remain skeptical.\\n\\n“I warned about this a year ago,” Gerber said. “Tesla needed to work to separate itself from Elon... now it might be too late.”\\n\\nFor now, the pressure is mounting. As Tesla’s challenges grow, so do questions about whether its leadership and brand can recover.\\n\\nRead Next:\\n\\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target –\\n\\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK. , plus unlimited access to cutting-edge tools and strategies to gain an edge in the markets.\\n\\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\\n\\nThis article originally appeared on\\n\\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

In the paper, he identified seven fundamental variables (earnings, return on equity, return on assets, accrual operating profitability to equity, cash operating profitability to assets, gross profit to assets and net payout ratio) that he combined into a single fundamental momentum measure. He showed that stocks in the top 20% of the universe according to that measure outperformed the market going forward.

The report highlights that Tesla passes all the fundamental and momentum requirements in Huang's model making it an appealing stock based on this strategy.\",\n                \"tags\": [\n                    \"button\",\n                    \"momentum\",\n                    \"fundamental\",\n                    \"stock\",\n                    \"validea\",\n                    \"tesla\",\n                    \"tsla\",\n                    \"model\",\n                    \"based\",\n                    \"strategy\",\n                    \"price\",\n                    \"table\",\n                    \"dashan\",\n                    \"huang\",\n                    \"market\",\n                    \"assets\",\n                    \"measure\",\n                    \"guru\",\n                    \"strategies\",\n                    \"published\",\n                    \"fundamentals\",\n                    \"score\",\n                    \"typically\",\n                    \"interest\",\n                    \"strong\",\n                    \"strategy's\",\n                    \"criteria\",\n                    \"analysis\",\n                    \"information\",\n                    \"paper\",\n                    \"outperformance\",\n                    \"return\",\n                    \"equity\",\n                    \"operating\",\n                    \"profitability\"\n                ],\n                \"third_model_score\": 0,\n                \"title\": \"TSLA Quantitative Stock Analysis - Nasdaq\",\n                \"url\": \"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tsla-quantitative-stock-analysis-83\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"agreement_rate\": 1,\n                \"company_names\": [\n                    \"Wells Fargo\",\n                    \"Tesla, Inc.\"\n                ],\n                \"confidence\": 1,\n                \"description\": \"After soaring in 2023 and 2024, shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have been battered for nearly three months now. Since the start of 2025, the largest U.S. EV-maker has seen its shares drop by more than -37%, and the stock is down more than -50% since hitting its all-time high on Dec. 17, 2024. Wells Fargo recently downgraded its price target for the Elon Musk-led company to $130. At the time of writing, the stock is trading for $242.41, meaning Wells Fargo’s revised target represents additional downside potential of -46.37%.\\n\\nThat’s an incredible fall for a stock that’s seemingly done nothing but go up (with various sell-offs along the way) over the past decade. Tesla’s meteoric rise has practically minted millionaires who jumped on the Elon Musk bandwagon in the early goings. That’s certainly a move that’s come with some baggage and volatility along the way. But overall, it’s clear that Musk’s visionary status has rewarded shareholders since Tesla’s IPO on June 29, 2010.\\n\\nThe stock has been showing signs of a bounce lately, too. Since hitting its one-month low on March 10, TSLA has gained 6.73% through midday on April 8. With Musk increasingly cozying up to President Trump, market expectations for a positive regulatory environment for Tesla have provided a temporary boost to the EV maker’s valuation. But with the so-called “Trump bump” devoting into the “Trump slump” and having reversed all of its gains through early April, many investors are unclear as to where this stock could be headed over the next year.\\n\\n24/7 Wall Street conducted analysis to provide more clarity. Let’s dive into whether the recent in Tesla’s stock price can be expected to continue, or if this is a top growth name that can rebound to new all-time highs and resume its march higher.\\n\\nKey Points About This Article:\\n\\nTesla has been among the key beneficiaries of a new Trump administration, though much of the benefits investors saw into the end of last year have since dissipated.\\n\\nLet’s dive into where the largest U.S. EV maker could be headed over the course of the next year.\\n\\nIf you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our brand-new “The Next NVIDIA” report.

Core EV Business: Tesla’s most important business line is unsurprisingly the company’s auto business. With sales of the company’s EVs down on a year-over-year basis, and margins also declining from historically high levels following the onset of the pandemic, investors will continue to assess the company’s future prospects in proportion to how the company’s core revenue and earnings driver is performing.\\n\\n2. Autonomous Driving (FSD), Robotics and More: Tesla’s value can be ascribed to what many long-term investors view as a call option on some other key growth categories CEO Elon Musk continues to work on. Aside from the company’s core electric vehicle offering, Tesla’s energy business, its FSD platform, humanoid robotics endeavors, AI verticals, and other growth categories make this stock unique in terms of the breadth and number of potential catalysts investors can look to for future growth. Of course, the extent to which these endeavors deliver boosted margins (or increased CapEx) remains to be seen.\\n\\n3. Macro and Political Environment: Like it or not, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cozied up to president Trump in a big way. This move is one that’s been broadly cheered by the overall market, at least out of the gate. Tesla stock soared following Donald Trump’s election victory, though Tesla has since given up its gains since this pivotal event, and has trended lower for seven straight weeks following the election. We’ll have to see if the Trump administration brings forward the sort of regulatory environment so many investors had hoped for in 2025 and in the years to come.\\n\\nWhat Wall Street Thinks\\n\\nTesla’s stock price outlook for 2025 varies widely among analysts, reflecting uncertainties in production, market conditions, and EV advancements. span a very wide range, with the most bearish analyst putting forward a $24.86 price target, and the most bullish suggesting this stock could head to $475 per share.\\n\\nThus, there’s not really a true idea of where this stock is headed. And when investors think about the fact that many of these analyst projections are outdated, doing the math on where this stock could be headed over the course of the next year isn’t as easy as it seems.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that analysts remain largely bullish on the stock, though.However, given how far Tesla has fallen from its peak, even if the company can hit this target over the next year, it’ll still have a ways to go to make it to a new all-time high. The thing about Tesla and other high-growth stocks is that I find analysts are often chasing the returns these stocks provide. Thus, I think it’s best for most investors to steer clear of using analyst price targets as anything other than guardrails. Indeed, Tesla is one company I think is worth doing one’s own DCF analysis on and coming to one’s own price target.\\n\\nTesla’s 2025 Outlook\\n\\nAs we move through 2025, analyst opinions on where Tesla could be headed do vary. Overall, Tesla’s stock performance in 2025 is expected to be shaped by production output, market trends and advancements in EV and battery technology. Analysts project a, driven by growing demand and energy sector expansion. Tesla’s 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below Bloomberg’s consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla’s earlier estimates.\\n\\nDespite a 62.5% stock surge in 2024, an raised concerns. CEO Elon Musk remains optimistic, expecting a 20-30% delivery increase, though management later emphasized a “return to growth.”\\n\\nTo add, competition from Waymo and declining registrations in Germany, France, and California present challenges. Tesla’s push into AI and autonomous driving, including plans for a Robotaxi launch, could be a game-changer.\\n\\nTesla Stock 2025 Price Target\\n\\nGiven analysts’ expectations, Tesla presents significant upside potential after it has experienced a major correction after hitting its six-month high on Dec. 17. Since then, the stock has lost nearly -43% amid the broader market’s sell-off, which began in late February and has carried into March.\\n\\nBased on Wall Street analysts’ estimates, the consensus one-year median price target for shares of TSLA is $306.62, which implies 26.48% upside potential from its current price. The stock currently receives a “Hold” rating, with 14 analysts rating it a buy, 11 rating it a hold and 12 rating it a sell.\\n\\nOn the other hand, 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month Tesla price target for Tesla is more bullish at $360, which represents upside potential of 48.50%. Those figures are based on the company seeing projected revenue growth climb from $112.091 billion in 2025 to $297.430 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $2.85 in 2025 to $11.61 in 2030.\",\n                \"finbert_score\": 9.477826952934265,\n                \"published date\": \"Tue, 08 Apr 2025 16:30:03 GMT\",\n                \"publisher\": {\n                    \"href\": \"https://247wallst.com\",\n                    \"title\": \"24/7 Wall St.\"\n                },\n                \"regions\": [\n                    \"North America\",\n                    \"Europe & Central Asia\"\n                ],\n                \"score\": 4.738913476467133,\n                \"second_model_score\": 0,\n                \"sectors\": [\n                    \"Financials\",\n                    \"Consumer Discretionary\",\n                    \"Information Technology\"\n                ],\n                \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n                \"summary\": \"Tesla's stock has significantly declined since late 2024, facing a nearly -43% drop.

Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th. Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\\n\\nEXPORTER TAX CREDIT: Trump administration officials are debating the merits of creating a new exporter tax credit, which would be geared toward boosting U.S. manufacturers and issued at the end of the year to offset the effects of retaliatory tariffs as American companies seek to sell their goods in foreign markets, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg’s Nancy Cook and Saleha Mohsin.\\n\\nCOUNTER-TARIFFS: The European Commission proposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a range of U.S. goods on Monday in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum, a document seen by Reuters showed. The tariffs on some goods will come into effect May 16 and others on December 1, according to the document, which also showed that bourbon was removed from the original list the Commission was weighing in March.\\n\\nGREAT CALL WITH SOUTH KOREA: President Trump said via , “I just had a great call with the Acting President of South Korea. We talked about their tremendous and unsustainable Surplus, Tariffs, Shipbuilding, large scale purchase of U.S. LNG, their joint venture in an Alaska Pipeline, and payment for the big time Military Protection we provide to South Korea. They began these Military payments during my first term, Billions of Dollars, but Sleepy Joe Biden, for reasons unknown, terminated the deal. That was a shocker to all! In any event, we have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries. Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good. We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States. Like with South Korea, we are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. ‘ONE STOP SHOPPING’ is a beautiful and efficient process!!!

The adjustments are a short-term stopgap while Apple attempts to win an exemption from President Trump’s tariffs — which Chief Executive Tim Cook obtained during the first Trump administration. The company sees the situation as too uncertain to upend long-term investments in its supply chain, the people said. Trump’s tariff package raises levies on Chinese goods to at least 54% while imposing a 26% rate on Indian goods, the authors note.\\n\\nAMERICAN WHISKEY: Industries across the U.S. are bracing for higher prices for import ahead of tariffs as well as new restrictions on their exports as countries prepare to retaliate, Alan Rappeport of The New York Times . While Trump aims to protect domestic sectors such as steel and aluminum, his tariff strategy is putting the economic squeeze on other American industries. America’s whiskey industry has become a favorite target for retaliation, and the blowback is painful for dstillers and the companies that supply them.

Akradi said he is hopeful the U.S. can use the new tariffs to negotiate rapid deals across the world to unwind the total amount of levies in global trade. “The strategy of saying ‘we want to be treated correctly, fairly, and with respect’ makes sense,” Akradi said, according to the Journal. “The word tariff is not a beautiful word.

China has retaliated with its own tariffs and further action is threatened.\",\n                \"tags\": [\n                    \"s\",\n                    \"trade\",\n                    \"apple\",\n                    \"tariff\",\n                    \"india\",\n                    \"china\",\n                    \"tariffs\",\n                    \"apple's\",\n                    \"nasdaq\",\n                    \"trading\",\n                    \"company\",\n                    \"press\",\n                    \"trump\",\n                    \"earlier\",\n                    \"granted\",\n                    \"current\",\n                    \"exemption\",\n                    \"dispute\",\n                    \"iphones\",\n                    \"analysts\",\n                    \"warned\",\n                    \"manufacturing\",\n                    \"aapl\",\n                    \"extended\",\n                    \"losses\",\n                    \"closed\",\n                    \"98\",\n                    \"172\",\n                    \"42\",\n                    \"pre-market\",\n                    \"07\",\n                    \"45\",\n                    \"20\",\n                    \"stock\",\n                    \"06\"\n                ],\n                \"third_model_score\": 0,\n                \"ticker\": \"AAPL\",\n                \"title\": \"iPhone Prices Could Soar as Tariff Standoff Threatens Apple's China-Heavy Supply Chain\",\n                \"url\": \"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iphone-prices-could-soar-tariff-134004919.html\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"agreement_rate\": 0,\n                \"company_names\": [\n                    \"Microsoft\",\n                    \"Apple Inc.\"\n                ],\n                \"confidence\": 0,\n                \"description\": \"The Wall Street Journal\\n\\nWed, April 9, 2025 at 9:39 PM GMT+8 1 min read\\n\\n↗️ Apple (AAPL): Shares rose nearly 3% Wednesday morning.

Traders wagering that the ETF would fall have so far accumulated paper profits of more than $6.1 billion this month, per an S3 report Tuesday.\\n\\nShorts stand to benefit from the wild intraday swings that erased trillions of dollars of market value, though it will ultimately depend on when they cash out on their wagers. With another $46 billion of new short bets made in April, according to S3, there’s a risk those contrarian wagers further amplify the next big shift in the market, especially if current weakness reverses and sends the major indexes higher.\\n\\n“Overall, the short side was an extraordinarily profitable trade up and down the market during this correction,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3, wrote. “81% of every short trade was profitable and 97% of every dollar shorted was a profitable trade.”\\n\\nOther contrarian bets that netted shorts the most gains include Apple Inc. (AAPL), Nvidia Corp (NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA). The Invesco QQQ Trust Series, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) Index, rounds out the top five most-profitable short trades so far in April. Each of the top five has so far netted paper profits of more than $2 billion for short sellers.\\n\\nMost of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks are included in the list of most profitable shorts so far in April. Meta Platforms Inc (META), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are also in the top fifteen. Outside of Nvidia, shorts have made solid bets that share prices of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. would decline.\\n\\nTotal short interest, or the dollar amount of total shares sold short, decreased by $114 billion — in part due to falling equity prices. In the event of a market rebound, short sellers will likely exit their negative positions by buying back shares, which could boost upside momentum for the overall market.\\n\\n“When the market hits a floor and starts trending upwards again, we should expect a slew of buy-to-covers as the mark-to-market increase of shares shorted creates a short side over-exposure in hedged portfolios and short sellers look to realize their mark-to-market gains,” said Dusaniwsky. “Short sellers will be shoulder to shoulder with momentum and FOMO traders buying into a future rally, exacerbating market volatility on the way up as they did on the way down.”\",\n                \"finbert_score\": 89.34379816055298,\n                \"published_date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 09:11:00 GMT\",\n                \"publisher\": \"Bloomberg\",\n                \"regions\": [\n                    \"North America\"\n                ],\n                \"score\": 54.67189908027649,\n                \"second_model_score\": 19.999999999999996,\n                \"sectors\": [\n                    \"Information Technology\",\n                    \"Consumer Discretionary\",\n                    \"Communication Services\"\n                ],\n                \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n                \"summary\": \"Amidst a stock market downturn triggered by escalating trade war concerns, short sellers have amassed $159 billion in paper profits in just six trading days.

This could intensify upward market movement as short sellers buy back shares to realize profits.\",\n                \"tags\": [\n                    \"short\",\n                    \"market\",\n                    \"sellers\",\n                    \"billion\",\n                    \"profitable\",\n                    \"trade\",\n                    \"bets\",\n                    \"s3\",\n                    \"shorts\",\n                    \"traders\",\n                    \"paper\",\n                    \"profits\",\n                    \"shares\",\n                    \"share\",\n                    \"index\",\n                    \"wagers\",\n                    \"contrarian\",\n                    \"dusaniwsky\",\n                    \"dollar\",\n                    \"shorted\",\n                    \"netted\",\n                    \"gains\",\n                    \"nvidia\",\n                    \"corp\",\n                    \"technology\",\n                    \"meta\",\n                    \"prices\",\n                    \"total\",\n                    \"buying\",\n                    \"momentum\",\n                    \"mark-to-market\",\n                    \"shoulder\",\n                    \"bloomberg\",\n                    \"wager\",\n                    \"price\"\n                ],\n                \"third_model_score\": 0,\n                \"ticker\": \"AAPL\",\n                \"title\": \"Short sellers mint $159 billion profit in 6 days as stocks sink\",\n                \"url\": \"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-mint-159-billion-131131012.html\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"agreement_rate\": 0.5,\n                \"company_names\": [\n                    \"Fidelity National Information Services\",\n                    \"Netflix\",\n                    \"Amazon\",\n                    \"Apple Inc.\"\n                ],\n                \"confidence\": 0.5,\n                \"description\": \"Apple (AAPL, Financials) temporarily reduced the cost of its , offering subscriptions at $2.99 per month through April 24 for new and returning users.

Apple's share price fell between 5% and 11% in the next three months during comparable events between April and August 2022. Those times, meanwhile, also showed upside potential from 11% to 26%.Apple's latest stock price drop occurs against more general global uncertainty, especially about tariff concerns and artificial intelligence capabilities like a customized Siri. Mohan warned that the possibility of relations with China to increase might harm profit projections.Mohan said, nonetheless, that Apple had several levers to control negative risk.

Amazon (AMZN+0.12%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.22%), and Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%) were also in the red. The renewed tariff war and surging yields have weighed heavily on growth names, reversing much of the sector’s 2025 momentum.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBond yields also surged, with the 30-year Treasury topping 4.75% — its highest since mid-February. “If Trump’s secret agenda is to crash the stock market to bring down long-term interest rates, the plan already failed,” economist Peter Schiff wrote on X. “The plan to crash the stock market is now crashing the bond market too.”\\n\\nDelta Air Lines plans to reduce capacity\\n\\nDelta kicked off the day with better-than-expected earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $0.46 versus the $0.38 expected by Wall Street. Adjusted revenue came in at $12.98 billion, matching forecasts, while net income jumped to $240 million, up from $37 million a year earlier. Shares rose more than 2% in premarket trading.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut while the headline numbers suggest resilience, Delta also said it plans to reduce flight capacity in the second quarter, signaling caution amid rising costs and shifting travel patterns. The airline cited the need to “restore operational reliability” and more tightly manage fuel and labor expenses.\\n\\nCracking a Corona — or cutting back? Constellation knows\\n\\nConstellation, the beverage giant behind Corona, Modelo, Kim Crawford, and Robert Mondavi, will report after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS of $2.27 on $2.12 billion in revenue. Watch for commentary on U.S. beer and wine sales — consumer staples that often shift in tone during periods of economic stress. Results could offer clues about household confidence as inflation lingers and real wages cool.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShifting retail signals from Walmart and Big Lots\\n\\nEarly Wednesday, Walmart said it was pulling its Q1 guidance due to uncertainty surrounding newly imposed Trump tariffs on Chinese goods, particularly electric vehicles and consumer electronics.

During the 2018 U.S.-China trade war, Apple received such an exemption for its iPhones, which are largely produced in China.\\n\\nAnalyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said the tariff uncertainty has upended Apples supply chain and could lead to iPhone prices as high as $3,500 if the company is forced to manufacture domestically.

They’ll be $3,500 iPhones,” he said, referring to fabrication plants, or high-tech manufacturing facilities where computer chips that power electronic devices are normally made.\\n\\nAnd even then, it would cost Apple about $30 billion and three years to move just 10% of their supply chain to the US to begin with, Ives told Burnett on Monday. CNN has reached out to Apple for comment.\\n\\nThe making and assembly of smartphone parts shifted to Asia decades ago, as American companies largely focused on software development and product design, which generate much higher profit margins. That move has helped make Apple one of the world’s most valuable companies and cement itself as a dominant smartphone maker.\\n\\nSince Trump’s inauguration in late January, Apple’s shares have lost around 25% of their value due to concerns about the impact of tariffs on its sprawling supply chain, which is highly dependent on China and Taiwan. About 90% of iPhones are assembled in China.\\n\\n“That’s why I think you see what’s happened to the stock, because no company is more caught up in this tariff front and center in this category five storm than Cupertino and Apple,” he said. “It’s an economic Armageddon, but especially for the tech industry.”\\n\\nThe chips that power iPhones are mainly manufactured in Taiwan, while its screen panels are supplied by South Korean companies. Some other components are made in China, and final assembly mostly takes place in the country.\\n\\nIn February, Apple announced it would invest in the US over the next four years as part of its effort expand production outside China and to avoid Trump’s tariffs on the country.\",\n                \"finbert_score\": -49.99808669090271,\n                \"published_date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 02:36:00 GMT\",\n                \"publisher\": \"CNN Business\",\n                \"regions\": [\n                    \"North America\",\n                    \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n                ],\n                \"score\": -39.999043345451355,\n                \"second_model_score\": -30,\n                \"sectors\": [\n                    \"Industrials\",\n                    \"Information Technology\"\n                ],\n                \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n                \"summary\": \"The article discusses the potential impact of US President Trump's tariffs on American consumers, particularly regarding the cost of Apple iPhones.

They’ve also tapped into the once-hot trend of “friend-shoring,” where firms look to shift supply chains away from China and toward U.S. allies.\\n\\nHowever, Trump plans to impose steep tariffs on the region—46% on Vietnam, 36% on Thailand, 49% on Cambodia, and 24% on Malaysia, for example. The countries have built large trade surpluses with the United States, as factories that make Nike apparel or Apple products have moved in.\\n\\n“This effectively closes off options for rerouting international trade flows, which means these countries will not only feel the full force of tariffs but there will be broader disruption to global supply chains,” Jeremy Leonard, managing director of global industry services at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nSoutheast Asian Countries Are Looking to Make a Deal—As Apparel Makers Hold Their Breath\\n\\nChanges may be coming as Wednesday's tariff deadline approaches. Cambodia has offered to cut tariffs on U.S. goods, Indonesia is offering to negotiate and Thailand is seeking to boost U.S. imports.\\n\\nTrump has said Vietnam has offered to cut its tariffs to zero.

The Cboe Volatility Index spiked above 50, a level associated with extreme market stress.\\n\\n“Traders were overenthusiastic about this morning’s rally, which then succumbed under the weight of negative news flow: 104% Chinese tariffs, a record low Yuan, and a sloppy 3-year auction,” wrote Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.\\n\\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told a Congressional hearing on Tuesday that President Donald Trump made clear he won’t issue tariff exemptions in the near term. In addition to the 104% duty on China, Vietnam will be hit with a 46% levy and imports from Japan face a 24% tax.\\n\\n“Right now we’re watching investors try to assign logic to a market that’s being driven more by vibes than valuation,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Financial Inc. “The S&P briefly tumbled into bear territory, and everyone’s pretending there’s a playbook for this. There isn’t.”\\n\\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote that “market concerns are likely to persist as long as President Trump’s approach to negotiations with China remain unconstructive.”\\n\\nTo Nomura Securities’ Charlie McElligott, tariffs will drag growth lower in the weeks and potentially months ahead, regardless of occasional rallies driven by short covering and potential mechanical flows.\\n\\nThe stock market is particularly vulnerable to wild swings due to a combination of thin liquidity and headline-driven algorithmic trading. According to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk, the gap between market volume and liquidity in S&P 500 futures is currently the widest in the bank’s data set.\\n\\n“Liquidity is terrible so anyone with just a decent-sized order is going to move the market,” said Brent Kochuba, founder of SpotGamma.\\n\\nFrom a technical analysis prospective, the S&P 500 broke below its support level of 5,000, plunging again into a deeply oversold territory. The index’s 14-day relative strength index sank to 20.7.\\n\\nAnother test for stocks starts this Friday as earnings season kicks off, starting with results from big US banks including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Co.\\n\\nFor the first quarter, analysts now see year-over-year earnings growth of 6.7% for the S&P 500, down from about 11.1% in early November when Trump was elected, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. For all of 2025, they see profits rising 9.4%, compared with a forecast of 12.5% at the beginning of the year.\\n\\nDelta Air Lines Inc., CarMax Inc. and Constellation Brands Inc. also report earnings this week, and are expected to discuss the wide-ranging impact of tariffs on their customers and supply chains at earnings calls.\\n\\n--With assistance from Jan-Patrick Barnert, Geoffrey Morgan and Michael Msika.\\n\\n(Updates stock moves.

Optimistic on Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) (3:00). Spotlight on CoreWeave IPO and its new category (6:20). Bearish on Tesla long-term (14:40). Updates on Nvidia and 3 semiconductor stocks (19:15).\\n\\nTranscript\\n\\nRena Sherbill: Sara Awad, welcome back to Investing Experts. Always great to be talking to you on Seeking Alpha. You write under Tech Stock Pros and you have an investing group called Tech Contrarians.\\n\\nSo with an obvious focus on tech and an eye towards that sector, but also navigating, as you mentioned before I hit record, these historical times we find ourselves in, how do you see this present moment broadly, market wise speaking, and then more specifically as it pertains to the tech sector?\\n\\nSara Awad: First thing, thanks for having us on. It's really always a pleasure. I mean, to say the least, it's been a tough week for stocks. The global markets obviously really aren't liking the liberation data. It's looking like a tight situation with the Fed staying steady on this wait and see strategy. But this is definitely one that's going down in the books.\\n\\nInteresting time to be in the market. Also, a stressful time to be in the market. In terms of tech and how everything is playing playing out, there's a lot of opportunity on the table from where we're standing.\\n\\nThere's a lot of names with good fundamentals. Broadcom (AVGO), for example, is the first that comes to mind, that we think are gonna fare better than than other guys in this space.\\n\\nAnd today, we're seeing kind of some relief to the tariff situation. There's a lot of uncertainty still coming tomorrow with the the threat of an additional 50% tariff on China.\\n\\nWe don't think that is gonna matter much. We don't expect, at least from the current visibility or standpoint, China to really budge because with the current tariffs on China, already sales there are gonna get hit.\\n\\nSo what is an additional 50 if if the that percentage is is already in terms of sales at zero? So we think that it really everything comes down to perspective.\\n\\nAnd in terms of of whether China is gonna budge or fight to the end, we really think China's gonna stick to its grounds on this and hope for negotiations to kind of play out, but it really seems from the current visibility that the US China trade wars are really here to stay, although the rest of the world might really go for another tactic in terms of negotiating and cutting deals to ease the situation.\\n\\nRS: So what does that mean for tech? And you also you mentioned Broadcom that they are poised to do better. Why is that?\\n\\nSA: We're optimistic on Broadcom, although it's an AI play. And, basically, what we touched upon in our previous podcast regarding DeepSeek is this idea that DeepSeek introduced a lower need for compute spend.\\n\\nBecause if we look at AI in terms of inferencing and training, DeepSue showed us that when it comes to inferencing, we can now do inferencing at a 97% lower compute power.\\n\\nSo that comes with the idea that maybe this AI spend that the entire market thought was very necessary that all these tier one players have been spending, hundreds of billions on isn't really as necessary as we thought.\\n\\nAnd since last time we spoke, the Alibaba (BABA) chairman pointed that out, talking about how a lot of these companies are spending too much on AI ahead of demand, really.\\n\\nSo, basically, where Broadcom fits into this is, yes, it's exposed to AI, and, yes, it could see impact from this AI bubble, let's say, deflating rather than popping.\\n\\nBut at the same time, Broadcom has more of an offset. So if we look at Broadcom in terms of its its businesses, it has its software side of the business and also when it comes to its semiconductor side of the business.\\n\\nThey're in the AI ASIC business, where they compete closely with Marvell (MRVL).\\n\\nAnd, for example, we downgraded Marvell, but we're still positive about Broadcom. And part of that reason is we think that the AI ASIC business is gonna pressure margins. And when that happens, Marvell is likely to get more pressure than Broadcom because Broadcom has a margin offset, which is its networking side of the business, which really should be growing even with the situation playing out.\\n\\nSo we think Broadcom's better positioned to ride this wave from a fundamental standpoint if we're looking a year out.\\n\\nRS: And what else would you say about noticing the present moment, but also keeping an eye towards the near term future, the long term future. What is it that you find the most opportunistic or perhaps places to stay away from?\\n\\nSA: The market right now, everything is really crashing. So there's really opportunity everywhere, but that really goes down to tailoring the advice depending on the investor.\\n\\nSo there's a lot of guys that wanna get in, and they wanna get out real quick. These guys are gonna, for example, ride up the weakness. So we always like to say market is driven by greed and fear.\\n\\nAnd if we look at the reaction post tariffs last week, late Thursday and Friday, Monday, and then today, we can really see that there's there's no solid reason for markets to be coming back today.\\n\\nTariffs haven't got away. Trump had one tweet about talks with South Korea and optimism about things getting better with China, but nothing really tangible is on the table yet.\\n\\nSo in terms of of jumping into the market, we're still looking at a market that's that's in the panic zone.\\n\\nAnd I'd say that this market's been in the panic zone since that Deepseek moment. So when it comes to jumping back in, we like to advise on jumping back into stocks with with steady fundamentals.\\n\\nAlthough other guys with with weaker fundamentals may see a bounce back just on that weakness and be good for a quick trade. But when it comes really to the fundamentals, we're optimistic over the next year.\\n\\nLet's so let's say longer term on guys like, Broadcom, on guys like Micron (MU). We like Micron on the memory front, but we do think there's some tariff risks there and on guys like Meta (META), for example.\\n\\nSo there's a lot of opportunity, but it's also about gauging the fundamentals that are really carried through even when this whole greed and fear phase eases.\\n\\nRS: Something that to me is somewhat indicative of this volatile market and one that's hard to parse between numbers going very high and then very low versus the fundamentals, what is a victim of the market that we are in right now versus what can do better as the days and months move on. That's the hope anyways.\\n\\nA new stock that represents that to me is CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV), which recently had an IPO and has a lot of volatility to it. What are your thoughts there? You recently wrote about it on Seeking Alpha.\\n\\nSA: For CoreWeave, we think that now CoreWeave and the entire NeoCloud kind of peer group is is really getting center stage or, let's say, spotlight in the market, and that's because of the CoreWeave IPO.\\n\\nBut, I think a lot of people still don't get what this market is. Like, what do they do exactly? So just for a quick background there, basically, it's a new category of cloud providers that's emerging in face of what the market expects to be ballooning AI demand.\\n\\nDemand for AI infrastructure. And simply, what these guys do is that they rent GPUs as a service. And CoreWeave is considered one of the top players here. From semi analysis, they got the platinum rating, and they're alone in that category while everyone else is kind of in the gold and the silver and the bronze categories in terms of their offerings.\\n\\nThey launched this IPO, and unfortunate for them, they launched it at a really stressful moment for the market when already post Deepseek, there's a lot of panic about, are we spending too much on AI, and what is this AI demand gonna look like going forward?\\n\\nNow this is all gauged for the coming year because if we take a step back and really look back at the longer trajectory of things, AI is really just getting started. So the IPO for CoreWeave really did happen at a tough moment for them.\\n\\nThe original plan was to sell 40 something like 49,000,000 shares priced between 47 and $55 for downsizing that IPO to around 23% less than the original plan. They did the IPO with around 37,000,000 shares priced at $40. 40 bucks per share. And since then, it hasn't been trading, I think, for ten trading days even yet.\\n\\nThe stock has has been extremely volatile. So we we first shared our long term thesis, which was that we think that there's a structural issue with this idea of renting GPUs, as a service.\\n\\nI wanna get into that a bit in terms of the longer term structural risk and then complement that with the near term outlook. Because in the near term, we think CoreWeave can do well. And the reason why we think CoreWeave can do well is because, basically, they're not gonna go for an IPO if they don't have a strong pipeline.\\n\\nStructurally, these guys, NeoCloud, whether CoreWeave or the other guys in the peer group are gonna face trouble because now we're in the middle of this boom, but this boom won't last forever.\\n\\nOver time, even if they have a strong pipeline, now that pipeline is likely to dwindle. The problem with these companies is that they have to keep spending. If we look at the structural issue that we pointed out and we start with that long term thesis, the biggest risk we see for CoreWeave is this risk of the tech being outdated and outdated very fast.\\n\\nBecause we know that specifically when it comes to compute power, the industry is moving very fast. And, you know, NVIDIA (NVDA) is pushing that industry to move incredibly fast.\\n\\nJust, last month at the GTC, Jensen came out with a four year road map, which is really unheard of in terms of the tech industry to go ahead and offer a four year road map. And the reasoning behind that was because he wanted to derisk tech planning and prep the industry and the supply chain for what's to come.\\n\\nAnd so guys like CoreWeave, for example, they have 250,000 GPUs that they're renting as a service. And the bulk of those GPUs are from the hopper generation, which is already, as of today, outdated. So that's an issue because the benefit of having tech and the benefit of a higher average selling price or the ASP is only high when the tech is fresh.\\n\\nSo right now, Hopper's already not fresh. Blackwell is the next best thing, and Jensen really didn't shy away from pointing that out at the GTC. Noting, if I'm I'm not mistaken, something along the lines of, Hopper is good for some circumstances, but not many.\\n\\nAnd knowing that Blackwell is is 2.5% faster than Hopper, already Blackwell has its edge. And next year or the year after, we're gonna have new tech that's gonna make this risk of the tech that CoreWeave is sitting on now being outdated much higher.\\n\\nNow that's bad for guys like CoreWeave because if you don't have the freshest stack, you can't rent it for a good price tag. And if you can't rent it for a good price tag, then you're not gonna be able to turn a profit.\\n\\nAnd so while in the near term, CoreWeave definitely has enough a strong enough pipeline to have gone public. When you're a public company, things start to become quarter to quarter.\\n\\nThey need to maintain that growth, and they need to keep growing. And it'll be harder and harder for them to get the funds that they need to buy the newest tech and to keep up that growth as a public company over time.\\n\\nBasically, from the the longer term perspective, we think there's this risk of the tech being obsolete, basically being outdated.\\n\\nIn the short term, we think that the company went public, so they're they have a strong pipeline to support them. But longer term, their competitors are gonna be the tier one guys. So we're talking Microsoft (MSFT). We're talking Amazon (AMZN).\\n\\nAnd these guys are gonna be the competitors, no longer the the customers. So as of now, for example, Microsoft is a major customer of CoreWeave. I think at around 64% of total revenues for CoreWeave came from Microsoft in 2024.\\n\\nWhen this customer becomes a bigger competitor, when the tier one guys are more prepared and they become the competition, we think guys like CoreWeave are gonna get a lot more pressure.\\n\\nLonger term, there's this risk of the tech being outdated. And to offset that risk, you need to keep spending and raising funds. And they are gonna be competing with tier one players that have a lot more capital, that have a lot more funds.\\n\\nAnd so they're they're looking at sales getting pressured, which is never good when you when you're a public company. It's really not affordable.\\n\\nRS: So looking towards the future, I have these weekly conversations with Brian Stewart, who's our director of news at Seeking Alpha. And one of the things he's been talking about happening at the end of April are the tech earnings coming and there will be more guidance in terms of putting more specific figures around how much AI spending will be done.\\n\\nIs that something you're also looking forward to seeing or sensing that's coming/what are the things that you're looking towards these tech earnings that are coming in a couple weeks?\\n\\nSA: Definitely excited for the tech earnings coming up, excited for the season. It's gonna be an eventful one. And, basically, what we're tracking is specifically what you're talking about. So we're looking at how much this CapEx spent from the tier one guys.\\n\\nSo we tracked specifically four guys because these guys, what they spend in terms of cloud compute really determines the trajectory of of the entire CapEx spend for the industry.\\n\\nSo we're looking at Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL).\\n\\nSo as of as of now, the estimated CapEx spend for these guys is around and if we add an Oracle (ORCL) to that mix, is around something like 320,000,000,000, which is an incredibly high number.\\n\\nMicrosoft alone is looking at to spend around 80,000,000,000 this year. Meta, somewhere between 60 and 65,000,000,000. Amazon, up to a hundred, and Google, around 75,000,000,000. So we're talking about crazy spend, especially if we compare that, Alibaba that's spending around 52,000,000,000 over the next three years, if I'm not mistaken.\\n\\nSo what we're expecting is to see some pullback in terms of that CapEx spend for the year, either a pullback or a pushout where, for example, management comes out and says, okay. We're gonna push this CapEx to also include part of our CapEx for next year.\\n\\nAnd the reason we're seeing that is in forecasting that really since the Deepseek moment is because we now know that we're able to do this inferencing side of AI at a much lower cost. So we're expecting something to happen along that line, and we're already seeing signs of this playing out with Microsoft canceling some of its data center leases, but still holding on to that 80,000,000,000 CapEx number for the year.\\n\\nSo we expect to see more and more of that. Maybe not in this current quarter, but we definitely expect to see that happening or playing out to some extent.\\n\\nWe're seeing more management commentary on that in the second half of the year, especially when Blackwell's had a shortage and things have settled down in terms of really resetting this this compute spend for the year.\\n\\nRS: A specific stock that I wanted to ask you about is Tesla. We recently did a bull bear conversation here on Investing Experts.\\n\\nI'm curious if you would share your thoughts with our listeners, what your thoughts are on Tesla.\\n\\nSA: Our sell rating on Tesla is more for the longer term. And so, basically, we think that the issue with Tesla is that Tesla was the go to industry, go to EV brand for a while. Everyone associated EV with Tesla. More and more, that's not necessarily the case.\\n\\nSo we wrote on Tesla back in 2022, and there was an S&P forecast that by 2025, Tesla's,market share would drop below 20%. And what we've really seen play out over the past couple of years is Tesla really getting pressured, not only from becoming a political symbol with everything that's going on with Musk and Musk being in the White House, but also in terms of Chinese competition coming through.\\n\\nI think what a lot of people don't notice about Tesla is that while Tesla continues to be this big brand globally, it is getting pressured by competition that didn't exist as powerfully as it does today around three, four, or even two years ago.\\n\\nSo BYD (OTCPK:BYDDF), for example, is very close to to outpacing Tesla in terms of global sales, and that's something that they're doing even while maneuvering tariffs globally.\\n\\nSo we think that things could be increasingly difficult for Tesla in the long run and that there needs to be this reset of expectations for Tesla not as this industry go to or the king of EVs, but more as one of the players that needs to really deliver on promises to truly compete.\\n\\nWhen we published that longer term thesis, we had three reasons in mind. The first was that politics were making things very mess messy and that at this point, you can't really dissociate Tesla from Musk. So we saw everything that that broke out in the anti Musk protest, the vandalism of cyber trucks, of charging stations, etc. And a lot of backlash in terms of not wanting to buy Teslas because of these political associations.\\n\\nAnd at the end of the day, even if Teslas are the best, which there's a lot of debate about nowadays, at the end of the day, you care about sales. You care about the consumer. And if there's this pushback from consumers, if we're seeing Tesla sales drop in Europe, if we're seeing Tesla sales drop in China year over year, then there is a red flag there.\\n\\nAnd more than the Tesla sales drop, even if the general EV demand is there, we're looking at other guys coming in penetrating this place and taking those those sales.\\n\\nSo we had that first reason in terms of politics. The second one was that China is something that really Tesla can't ignore anymore, they can't afford to ignore. I think there was an interview with Musk a couple years back where where he was being asked about the Chinese competition in BYD, and he kind of laughed it off. But it seems like this is an increasingly important conversation to be had, and I think that there would be more faith in Tesla if investors knew that this was a risk being taken seriously.\\n\\nBecause now BYD has God's eye. Tesla's still working on having the FSD, which should be coming out later this summer. So there's a real risk there that needs to be addressed, that isn't getting enough attention from management or at least enough commentary in terms of what's the strategy there.\\n\\nAnd the third thing is is we looked at the supply chain. So we looked at on semiconductor, which which Tesla is a customer of, being an SIC chipmaker. And we realized that there's a correlation to an extent, not in the stock price performance between the two, but in terms of on semis auto sales, the bulk of which go to Tesla or the bulk of which are made up by Tesla orders and Tesla's production numbers.\\n\\nSo we realized that the two of them are now on a downward trend, and we we drafted this up back in February, and we were able to basically predict that the deliveries number and the production number would be much lower for this quarter, the ones that were announced earlier last week.\\n\\nSo we think there's a correlation there that also adds as a red flag that something is wrong in terms of of the trajectory of things for Tesla. And the stock has, I think out of the magnificent seven, it's gotten hammered the most, something like over 40% down year to date.\\n\\nBut at the same time, we think there's this higher risk in terms of long term trajectory for Tesla, and expectations need to reset. Our main idea was that we think that Musk's twenty to 30% growth targets for the year will be very hard to achieve from a current standpoint, especially with the tariffs, especially if Europe goes ahead and puts retaliatory tariffs and we see the situation escalate.\\n\\nRS: I also wanted to ask your updated thoughts around NVIDIA, which you expressed some concerns around last time you were on, and also the three semiconductor names that you were bullish on last time.\\n\\nSA: NVIDIA is a tricky one. We think that there could be trouble for NVIDIA. I think we touched on this in the lab last podcast that we think there's gonna be some trouble for NVIDIA, especially after Blackwell's no longer in shortage.\\n\\nBecause the rule in the sentence is anything in shortage is gonna see, double ordering and a lot of demand. So once Blackwell is not in shortage anymore, we're looking at a different situation in terms of sales growth numbers. We think there might be an issue there, when they print this quarter, in terms of what their outlook for the July will be.\\n\\nAt the same time, we did advise our guidance and the Investing Group to get them on NVIDIA for a quick trade if it dips lower than a hundred bucks.\\n\\nAnd so that was if I'm not mistaken, that was yesterday. We saw a dip to the to the low nineties, and then we saw it kinda bounce back today. So we think for the near term, this is a quick trade, but we wouldn't recommend being in the stock into print from the current point of visibility because there's a higher risk on what this July outlook will be.\\n\\nThe more broader term outlook for the year is that whisper numbers are extremely high when it comes to NVIDIA. And we think those will be also extremely hard to achieve if we're looking at a softer July outlook and if our thesis about these tier one guys pulling back or pushing out their CapEx spend plays out.\\n\\nIf these guys are pushing back or pulling back their CapEx spend, then we're looking at slower and moderating growth for NVIDIA.\\n\\nAnd, NVIDIA's really trained the market to expect a beat and a raised guidance every quarter. I think, since May 2023. If we see any break to that trajectory, then I think that the stock could trade lower. But under 90, under a hundred bucks, it makes for a good near term trade before that print, if we're looking from a fundamental perspective.\\n\\nSo the semi cap guys are in an interesting position. There's a bit of there's a bit of risk with the tariff situation playing out, but we think if we're taking a longer term perspective on things, a year or more out, the semi cap guys, (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX), and (AMAT), specifically ASML and Lam Research should still be in a good position.\\n\\nAnd the reason is because ASML has this monopoly on EUV demand. And although this year, we're seeing the demand recovery in terms of PCs and smartphones kind of take a bump, especially with the tariff situation that could really pressure demand with increased prices in the US and in other markets with everything playing out.\\n\\nWe still think that at the end of the day, TSMC (TSM) and these chipmakers will eventually need to up their wafer fabrication equipment spend. So that that spend should go up. That spend goes up, and we're looking at ASML growing its backlog and bringing in more orders. And so between these three, we'd say our favorite picks would be ASML in the long term and Lam Research in the long term.\\n\\nAnd the reason why I single out Lam over AMAT is because lower exposure to the legacy market and higher exposure to the memory market, which could be doing better if we don't see hiccups in this demand recovery from the tariff situation. So we're really caught up in the in the tariff war and the trade war.\\n\\nThe longer term thesis remains for these guys, and they should be doing better in 2026. They've also come down a lot with the tariff situation, so there's more attractive entry points on the table.\\n\\nRS: Did you see the announcement that AMAT applied material CEO acquired shares this week? Anything noteworthy to share with investors about that?\\n\\nSA: We do track that. I did catch that. Positive sign, but at the same time, we don't really use that as a gauge in order to to know when to jump into the company.\\n\\nAMAT is definitely cheaper than Lam, and it's definitely got a lot more downside than Lam. Part of that is because AMAT reports later in the quarter. So ASML and Lam report at the beginning of the quarter, while AMAT is way further into the quarter.\\n\\nAMAT is a more attractive value pick in that sense, or not value pick, cheaper than the other two. But we think the fundamentals really stick more to to Lam Research and ASML.\\n\\nRS: Given these markets that we're in, given the state of the world that we're in and you run a tech service, Tech Contrarians, as we mentioned.\\n\\nWhat are subscribers asking these days, or what are they most concerned about, or what do you find yourself talking most about in terms of assuaging fears, I imagine, that are very present?\\n\\nSA: Yeah. Definitely. We get a lot of questions about the the magnificent seven, how to maneuver the situation, where to to jump back in.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to that, I think that they've come down a lot. I mean, biggest losers have been year to date, I think it's Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA).\\n\\nAnd there's still a lot of risks on the table, but what we advise is buying in tranches, and buying based on fundamentals. So that's been a a major point of concern.\\n\\nAt the same time, we're getting a lot more questions, especially since January until now about China and Chinese stocks. So a lot more people looking into BYD, a lot more people looking to diversify their portfolio. And it's worked well for a lot of people in terms of of Chinese stocks performance year to date. So whether that's Alibaba, BYD, or a lot of the smaller players.\\n\\nWhat we've seen is people diversifying more away from US equity. At the same time now with the recent crash, trying to gauge when is the right time to jump back in.\\n\\nAnd we're also seeing a lot of people want to diversify to different kind of sectors of tech. So recently, we added Rocket Lab (RKLB) to our coverage, and we've gotten some some nice questions there.\\n\\nSo Rocket Lab is now also on our radar. It also got hit over the past week, but we think the fundamentals on that one are pretty solid. Its competition with SpaceX (SPACE) is also proving to go well. They're proving to hold their ground there.\\n\\nI think when it comes to the NeoCloud guys, just to emphasize, in terms of the longer term trajectory, there is really something, there's a a structural issue there.\\n\\nIn terms of the short term, we think that these guys could do well, but longer term, they're looking at trouble.\\n\\nSo this is a stock that you you wanna own for the trade up, but then you don't wanna have the stock long term in your portfolio because then you're looking at a higher risk profile because of this risk of the tech being outdated. This constant need to spend.\\n\\nAnd something about CoreWeave that we didn't touch on too much is the fact that CoreWeave has a lot of debt. So that's not like, for example, other guys in that peer group like Nebius (NBIS) who doesn't have that high of a debt and isn't sitting on that much of a loss.\\n\\nSo although Core Wave is is better positioned in terms of its current client base and the strong pipeline that they're launching the IPO with that's gonna support the stock to outperform in the near term, we think longer term people should be a lot more cautious on this sector.\\n\\nI just wanna let listeners know that we always like to do a flash sale, especially when the markets are going through a rough time. We don't want people to worry about paying for financial advice.\\n\\nSo we'll have a flash sale this coming weekend for anyone who wants to to join the service, try it out, and not have to worry about expenses to make money.\\n\\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The stock is down nearly 30% from the all-time high it reached in February, while the S&P 500 is off by almost 18%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down almost 23%, firmly in bear market territory. But the social media company's sell-off may be seen by some as a buying opportunity.\\n\\nMeta owns the popular apps Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Messenger, and WhatsApp, so it isn't directly affected by the tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed on imported goods from nearly every country. But given that it derives most of its revenue from advertising, could it still wind up a victim of these tariffs?\\n\\nAdvertising budgets are in focus as tariffs surge\\n\\nThe bear case for Meta Platforms in the current environment is mainly tied to consumer sentiment. If tariffs, counter-tariffs, and trade wars cause the prices of goods to rise, consumers won't be able to buy as much. As a result, companies may reduce their advertising spending. Advertising is notoriously one of the first places companies cut their budgets to streamline costs during recessions and even in anticipation of economic downturns. That may happen here soon.\\n\\nWhile I'm not predicting a recession, tariffs will cause the price of goods to rise, decreasing spending power and having the same effect of leading consumers to be more conservative with their money. The jury is still out about how much these tariffs will affect the American consumer.\\n\\nBut if corporate advertising budgets are affected, Meta Platforms could be in for some pain. In the fourth quarter, Meta generated $48.4 billion in revenue, $46.8 billion of which came from advertising. Additionally, the operating margin from this division is outstanding. In Q4, its Family of Apps division posted a . Few companies can match this, but that's not Meta's overall profit margin.\\n\\nMeta is trying to get away from being a one-trick pony, so it's heavily investing in its Reality Labs division, which includes smart glasses, virtual reality headsets, and many other devices that integrate AI with commonly used items, as well as the company's metaverse platforms. However, the segment has thus far been a money pit. In Q4, Reality Labs booked revenue of $1.1 billion and an operating loss of $5 billion.\\n\\nIf one of these products becomes a hit, Reality Labs could completely transform how investors view Meta's stock. But as of now, advertising is its primary focus.\\n\\nSo, is Meta a stock to buy now? Or should investors avoid it?\\n\\nMeta's stock is far cheaper than it has been in some time\\n\\nFollowing the sell-off, Meta's stock now trades for a fairly attractive valuation.\\n\\nWhile we're still a long way away from the dirt-cheap levels the stock was trading at in early 2023, is an attractive valuation for Meta.\\n\\nShould its investments in cutting-edge technology pay off, and considering its digital platforms are some of the top places for advertisers, Meta will likely emerge just fine from this trade conflict. While I wouldn't be rushing to buy the stock right now with all of the activity in the market, I think it will be a great stock to pick up for the long haul in a few weeks once the dust settles, especially if we see some countries cut deals with Trump to get their tariffs lifted.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Meta Platforms. The Motley Fool has a .\\n\\nwas originally published by The Motley Fool\\n\\nFor much of the past two years, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were fueled to record levels thanks to a small collective of megacap artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Known as the \\\"Magnificent Seven,\\\" Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have largely been a good group of shares to own for the last couple of years.\\n\\nHowever, sentiment around these AI leaders has shifted significantly in 2025. As of this writing, each of the Magnificent Seven stocks has seen a negative return on the year. Nvidia's shares alone are down some 27% this year. Back in January, the chipmaker's market capitalization reached an all-time high of $3.7 trillion. Today, its valuation has cratered to $2.4 trillion.\\n\\nAfter losing over $1 trillion in market cap, is there any hope left for Nvidia investors? I think the answer is a resounding \\\"yes.\\\" Let's dig into what caused Nvidia stock to spiral, and explore what tailwinds could reignite some life back into the semiconductor darling.\\n\\nWhat caused Nvidia stock to drop like a rock?\\n\\nThere are several factors that have influenced the turbulence in Nvidia stock so far this year.\\n\\nFor starters, the stock took a big hit in late January after a Chinese start-up called released an AI model similar to ChatGPT, but claimed that it built and trained its AI on older Nvidia chipsets. Seemingly overnight, investors went into a panic, wondering how demand for Nvidia's newest chip architectures would be impacted, given the DeepSeek claims.\\n\\nOver the last two months, ongoing step by the White House to implement new tariff policies have caused more trepidation across the capital markets. Investors have naturally started wondering how other countries might react to tariffs, and how any retaliatory policies could affect trade, prices, shipping, and overall business operations.\\n\\nThese events have eventually morphed into one large, widespread tornado filled with fear. Given how much Nvidia stock has run up over the last two years, investors started taking gains and hoarding cash, given all the uncertainty over the broader macroeconomy and what specific business performances could look like going forward. Now what?\\n\\nWhy do I think Nvidia stock is poised to rebound?\\n\\nI know this information might paint a dismal picture for Nvidia, but smart investors know that there is much more to the story, besides some geopolitical tensions and competing AI platforms from overseas.\\n\\nFirst, some of Nvidia's largest customers include its Magnificent Seven cohorts. For example, cloud hyperscalers Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft all use Nvidia chips in their data centers. Moreover, leadership at Meta Platforms and Tesla have also specifically referenced their reliance on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPU) on multiple occasions -- typically during earnings calls.\\n\\nAs we learned during Q4 and full-year 2024 earnings a few weeks ago, cloud hyperscalers are forecasting nearly $260 billion of capital expenditure (capex) spend this year, with Meta Platforms adding potentially up to another $65 billion on top of that sum.\\n\\nOn top of this, investors have finally gotten a taste of how Nvidia's newest GPU architecture, Blackwell, is performing. During the fourth quarter, Blackwell generated $11 billion in revenue -- outperforming management's expectations. Moreover, during Nvidia's annual GTC conference a few weeks ago, CEO Jensen Huang revealed successor product lineups to Blackwell, underscoring Nvidia's commitment to innovation and the speed at which the company is moving.\\n\\nIn my eyes, Nvidia's business might actually be in the strongest position it's been since the AI revolution started in late 2022. These trends showcase how robust demand is for AI infrastructure, an opportunity Nvidia should likely benefit from, given the successful results of the Blackwell launch and the company's plans to continue releasing even more superior technology for years to come.\\n\\nIs now a good time to buy Nvidia stock?\\n\\nRight now, Nvidia's (P/E) ratio of just over 22 is the lowest it's been in a year.\\n\\nIn all honesty, I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia shares continue to fall in the near term. With that said, I think it's clear that the negativity surrounding Nvidia has more to do with broader concerns around the economy and less about the company's actual performance.\\n\\nGiven the company's current trajectory and continued accelerated demand from its largest customers, I think Nvidia's actual business is in good shape. Sure, tariffs could put a dent in the company's cost structure and take a nominal toll on margins in the short term, but Nvidia's long-term picture remains intact.\\n\\nI think now is a time to heed the advice of Warren Buffett by taking advantage of the fear in the markets and be a little greedy. Shares of Nvidia look dirt cheap right now, and I think in time, investors will begin to realize that the company's actual performance is still impressive -- despite some headaches in the broader market.\\n\\nMy prediction is that by the end of the year, much of the hoopla around tariffs and potential AI competition from overseas will subside, and Nvidia's financial performance will speak for itself. Hence, several months from now, I think Nvidia stock will experience some newfound excitement and rebound in epic fashion.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

While Meta's revenue is primarily from advertising, there are concerns that tariffs could impact consumer spending and subsequently, advertising budgets. Despite investments in Reality Labs, advertising remains Meta's primary focus. The stock's valuation is now attractive, and its leading digital platforms may allow it to weather the trade conflict. However, there's a suggestion to wait for market stability before investing and a recommendation to consider other top stocks with potentially higher returns.\\n\\n**Nvidia Stock Analysis:**\\n\\nNvidia's stock has dropped significantly due to various factors, including concerns about Chinese AI competition and trade tariffs. However, major clients like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft rely on Nvidia chips, and strong demand is still there for AI infrastructure. The Blackwell launch and future product releases are positives.  Currently, Nvidia's P/E ratio is the lowest in a year, and the stock may rebound as the market stabilizes. Despite this analysis, other top stocks with potentially higher returns exist.\\n\\n**Cambria Tail Risk ETF (TAIL):**\\n\\nThe Cambria Tail Risk ETF (TAIL) has reached a 52-week high due to recent market volatility, as investors seek to protect their portfolios.

How long they last could determine the fate of the U.S. economy. The tariffs of at least 10% against almost every country in the world have already been put in place, with additional tariffs against certain countries set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. early Wednesday morning, according to the White House.1 On Tuesday, Trump said on social media that he was negotiating lower tariffs with South Korea and other countries, and his top economic advisor, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, said 70 countries had called to make deals.2\\n\\nTalk of deals fueled speculation that his wide-ranging and aggressive tariffs would, in the end, amount to a negotiating tactic rather than an overturning of the post-WWII era of free trade.3 Trade deal hopes powered a stock market rally that at least temporarily reversed some of the losses over recent days.\\n\\nThe Next Few Days Could Be Vital For Tariffs\\n\\nSeveral forecasters said that the trajectory of the economy hinges on how quickly deals are reached and how long the tariffs stay in place. Economists at Goldman Sachs said the economy had a 45% chance of falling into a recession in the coming year, assuming Trump scaled back the tariffs significantly from what he announced last week.4 However, a recession is likely if the tariffs go into effect as Trump had initially outlined them, even if deals are negotiated later on, Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman, wrote in a commentary. \\\"A U.S. Administration that doubles down will have immense global implications for 2025 and the years and decades ahead,\\\" Jim Reid, head of thematic and macro research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a commentary. \\\"At the moment, there are few signs they are backing down, which will likely signal more market turmoil ahead. Rarely, if ever, have the next few days been so important.\\\"\\n\\nCould Stagflation Be Ahead?\\n\\nThe tariffs, should they stand, would likely drive up prices for U.S. consumers, given that many products are imported or built with parts or materials brought in from overseas. That would have far-reaching fallout for the economy. Just one example: UBS estimated that the iPhone 16, manufactured in China, could see its price increase by $350 from $1,119. That calculation was made a day before Trump threatened to hit China with an additional 50% tariff on top of the 54% tariff he had already announced, bringing the tariff rate to one of America's largest trading partners to 104%. At the same time, tariffs would slow business, reducing economic growth and risking a recession and a surge in unemployment. Deutsche Bank forecasts that the unemployment rate could jump as high as 5% by the end of the year, up from the range of 4% to 4.2%, where it's hovered for months. Slower growth and higher inflation could create \\\"stagflation,\\\" a financially painful condition for household budgets.\\n\\nIt Wouldn't Be the First Time Trade Policies Have Shifted Last Minute\\n\\nIn previous rounds of Trump's trade wars, the president has announced tariffs only to alter them at the last minute or negotiate deals shortly after the fact.\\n\\nThe rapidly shifting policy and the possibility that the tariffs will stick have left consumers and business leaders uncertain about the future, tanking consumer confidence. That uncertainty deepens the risks to the economy, Hatzius wrote. Short of Trump backing down or negotiating deals, the tariffs could be rescinded without Trump's say-so. Several lawsuits have challenged Trump's authority to impose the tariffs under emergency presidential powers.5 Lawmakers could also curtail Trump's tariff power. A bipartisan bill introduced last week would require the president to seek approval from Congress for any tariffs.6 The bill reportedly has the support of seven senators of the Republican majority but could face a veto from Trump.7\",\n                \"finbert_score\": -62.499381601810455,\n                \"published_date\": \"Tue, 08 Apr 2025 14:47:00 GMT\",\n                \"publisher\": \"Investopedia\",\n                \"regions\": [\n                    \"North America\",\n                    \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n                ],\n                \"score\": -54.49969080090523,\n                \"second_model_score\": -52.49999999999999,\n                \"sectors\": [\n                    \"Information Technology\",\n                    \"Financials\"\n                ],\n                \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n                \"summary\": \"President Trump's \\\"reciprocal\\\" tariffs on nearly all countries are set to take effect, raising concerns about the U.S. economy.

The tariffs, if lasting, would increase costs for consumers and slow business activity. However, Trump has previously altered tariffs at the last minute, and lawsuits and Congressional action could also limit his tariff power.

According to Bloomberg, the company also experienced a surge in in-store sales across the United States over the weekend, as consumers rushed to buy iPhones ahead of anticipated price hikes.\\n\\nRetail workers at multiple Apple locations said customers were concerned that iPhone prices would increase dramatically after the tariffs take effect. Employees said stores were unusually crowded for this time of year, with many shoppers directly asking whether prices would go up. While Apple has not issued guidance to retail teams on how to address customer concerns, the spike in traffic mirrored typical holiday shopping volumes.\\n\\nThe iPhone, Apple's highest-revenue product, is largely manufactured in China, putting it squarely in the path of the new tariffs. However, Apple has been shifting more of its production to India and Vietnam, where devices such as iPads, MacBooks and Apple Watches are increasingly assembled. These countries are currently expected to face lower U.S. import duties compared to China.\\n\\nApple has reportedly stockpiled devices to manage short-term supply pressures. The sales boom over the weekend could boost results for the company's fiscal third quarter, which ends in June. Because Apple is selling inventory produced before the proposed tariffs, the pricing impact is unlikely to appear before the fiscal fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg.\\n\\nIn the longer term, Apple is expected to manage tariff costs by compressing supplier margins and absorbing some expenses itself, rather than passing the full increase to consumers. The company's iPhone pricing has remained stable since 2017, with the current flagship model starting at $999.\\n\\nThe price shock comes ahead of Apple's second-quarter earnings report scheduled for May 1, when Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh are expected to address the situation.\\n\\nSome analysts have warned that prices could climb significantly if tariffs are fully implemented, though Apple may delay any immediate price increases. One retail worker said the current rush is unusual for April, which is typically the off-season for iPhone upgrades. Another said the momentum may continue in the days ahead, given consumer uncertainty.\\n\\nA shopper visiting from Buenos Aires told Bloomberg she bought an iPhone for her sister in advance of the tariffs. If we have the opportunity to buy something at a lower price, of course we are going to, she said.\\n\\nThis article first appeared on .\",\n                \"finbert_score\": 0,\n                \"published_date\": \"Tue, 08 Apr 2025 14:03:00 GMT\",\n                \"publisher\": \"GuruFocus.com\",\n                \"regions\": [\n                    \"North America\",\n                    \"South Asia\",\n                    \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                    \"Latin America & Caribbean\"\n                ],\n                \"score\": -4.999999999999999,\n                \"second_model_score\": -9.999999999999998,\n                \"sectors\": [\n                    \"Information Technology\"\n                ],\n                \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n                \"summary\": \"Apple saw a stock dip amidst tariff concerns but experienced a surge in iPhone sales as consumers feared impending price hikes.

With the Trump administration floating a 54% tariff on Chinese-made goodsincluding Apple's flagship devicesU.S. consumers rushed into stores, fearing sharp price hikes were imminent. According to reports from multiple locations, sales surged as worried buyers sought to lock in current prices, turning what's usually a quiet season into a full-blown buying spree. Despite the spike in foot traffic, Apple's stock dropped more than $500 billion in market cap over just two trading sessionsits steepest three-day decline since the dot-com fallout.\\n\\nInternally, Apple has been preparing for this scenario for months. The company quietly increased U.S. inventory to avoid near-term exposure and has continued shifting production to India and Vietnamregions expected to face lower tariffs than China. Analysts believe Apple will try to shield consumers from steep price increases by tightening margins and negotiating with suppliers. While social media is buzzing with rumors of iPhones costing over $2,000, most forecasts peg a more measured price bump, possibly in the $100$150 range for high-end models. Apple is also likely lobbying hard behind the scenes for tariff exemptions.\\n\\nLooking ahead, the timing could prove tricky. If tariffs take effect and stick through the summer, Q4coinciding with Apple's next iPhone releasecould be when the full impact hits. For now, the weekend rush might help cushion third-quarter earnings, but pressure will build as Apple navigates a volatile policy environment. Investors will be focused on how Apple balances pricing, margin protection, and demand retention in the months ahead. Whether the company maintains its premium product position without passing costs to consumers will be a key storyline going into the second half of 2025.\\n\\nThis article first appeared on .\",\n                \"finbert_score\": -49.89813566207886,\n                \"published_date\": \"Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:12:00 GMT\",\n                \"publisher\": \"GuruFocus.com\",\n                \"regions\": [\n                    \"North America\",\n                    \"South Asia\",\n                    \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n                ],\n                \"score\": -37.44906783103943,\n                \"second_model_score\": -25,\n                \"sectors\": [\n                    \"Information Technology\"\n                ],\n                \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n                \"summary\": \"Fearing potential tariffs on Chinese-made goods, U.S. consumers triggered a surge in Apple product sales over the weekend, trying to buy devices at current prices.

This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate. They’ve made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL’ USA! Our past ‘leaders’ are to blame for allowing this, and so much else, to happen to our Country.”\\n\\nThe President also said, “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!”\\n\\nTrump reporters aboard Air Force One Sunday night, “I don’t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” He added, “I’m willing to deal with China, but they have to solve their surplus.” On Truth Social earlier, Trump said, “We have massive Financial Deficits with China, the European Union, and many others. The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing Tens of Billions of Dollars into the U.S.A. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold. The Surplus with these Countries has grown during the ‘Presidency’ of Sleepy Joe Biden. We are going to reverse it, and reverse it QUICKLY. Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!”\\n\\nThe U.S. President said via Truth Social, “Countries from all over the World are talking to us. Tough but fair parameters are being set. Spoke to the Japanese Prime Minister this morning. He is sending a top team to negotiate! They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade. They don’t take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs. Likewise Agriculture, and many other “things.” It all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!”\\n\\nREADY TO NEGOTIATE: Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Union Commission, said via X: “Europe is ready to negotiate with the US. We have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods. Because we’re always ready for a good deal. But we’re also prepared to respond with countermeasures. And protect ourselves against indirect effects through trade diversion.”\\n\\nECONOMIC ARMAGEDDON: Wedbush lowered the firm’s price target on Tesla TSLA) to $315 from $550 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The economic Armageddon unleashed by the Trump Administration is a “double whammy” for Tesla in the firm’s view. Wedbush notes that Tesla is less exposed to tariffs than other U.S. automakers such as General Motors GM), Ford F), and Stellantis STLA) as well as foreign autos. The bigger worry in the firm’s opinion is Tesla’s success in China as this key region is the linchpin to the future success of Tesla. Furthermore, Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally, and that is “a very bad thing for the future of this disruptive tech stalwart and the brand crisis tornado that has now turned into an F5 tornado,” says the firm. It now estimates Tesla has lost/destroyed at least 10% of its future customer base globally based on self-created brand issues and this could be a conservative estimate.\\n\\nWedbush also lowered the firm’s price target on Apple AAPL) to $250 from $325, while keeping an Outperform rating on the shares. The “tariff economic Armageddon unleashed by Trump is a complete disaster for Apple given its massive China production exposure,” the firm tells investors in a research note. Wedbush says the current tariff slate with China at 54% and Taiwan at 32% “would be devastating to Apple, its cost structure, and ultimately consumer demand.” The firm, however, maintains a longer-term positive view on Apple shares citing the company’s strong free cash flow and the growth of its Services business.\\n\\nApple could finally be forced to make increases to the cost of iPhones in the U.S., Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman . Apple hasn’t raised the starting price of its flagship model from $999 since the debut of the iPhone X in 2017, but with tariffs hitting Apple’s major production sources, Gurman writes. Gurman says there’s still a chance CEO Tim Cook can secure “some sort of exemption.”\\n\\nANTI-OBESITY DRUGS: The Trump administration has declined to cover expensive, high-demand obesity treatments under the federal government’s Medicare program, Tom Murphy of The Associated Press . The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will not cover the medications under Medicare’s Part D prescription drug coverage. Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been an outspoken opponent of the injectable drugs, which have exploded in popularity due to the potentially life-changing weight loss that some patients experience, the report notes. The Fly notes that Novo Nordisk NVO) manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy, while Eli Lilly LLY) produces Zepbound.\\n\\nVIETNAM DEAL: Roth MKM keeps a Buy rating and $26 price target on Turtle Beach TBCH). Trump’s proposed 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam triggered a 30% slump in Turtle Beach share price last week, reflecting the company’s dependence on Vietnamese sourcing, the firm tells investors in a research note. As of late last week however, the prospect has emerged of an agreement between the U.S. and Vietnam to delay and possibly minimize tariffs, and should such an agreement be reached, it could spark a significant rally in the shares, Roth added.\\n\\nTIKTOK: A deal to spin off the U.S. assets of TikTok has been put on hold after China indicated it would not approve the deal after President Donald Trump’s tariffs announcement this week, Dawn Chmielewski, David Shepardson and Antoni Slodkowski of Reuters , citing two sources familiar with the matter.

These companies, backed by multibillion-dollar revenues, pay their Ireland-based employees well above national averages. A by the Irish economist John FitzGerald found multinationals paid Irish workers €37 billion ($40.4 billion), accounting for a third of all wages in the country.\\n\\nThat dynamic, according to Conall MacCoille, Chief Economist at Bank of Ireland, has contributed to Ireland’s increasingly unaffordable housing market. Average house prices in Ireland are now eight times the average income of €51,000 ($55,800), according to the MyHome report, the biggest gap since 2009.\\n\\nA Trump trade war, and the loss of high-paid jobs, could help reset that dynamic.\\n\\n“Ireland’s relatively thin, illiquid housing market, reliant on those at the top of the income distribution could be exposed to a sudden negative economic shock, such as the risk of a US-EU tariff war, especially if it were to disproportionately hit employment in the high-paid multinational sector,” said MacCoille.\\n\\nTrump has so far exercised restraint when it comes to Ireland’s cozy relationship with U.S. multinationals, despite goading Taoiseach Micheál Martin over the country’s attractive corporation tax policy. to the U.S., many of which are shipped from Ireland, were excluded from Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff onslaught, with the U.S. president’s ire towards Ireland currently linked to its EU membership.\\n\\nHowever, with the U.S. a $50 billion goods trade deficit with Ireland last year, that is by no means a permanent stance.\\n\\nThe idea that Ireland would achieve a more equitable housing market by sacrificing its high-paid tech and pharma workers is dangerous thinking.\\n\\nIn a January report, Dublin-based stockbroker Goodbody said Ireland’s dependence on U.S. multinationals meant the country from a Trump presidency comparable to the U.K.’s Brexit fallout.\\n\\nAnd for good reason. Multinational employees’ high share of Ireland’s wage intake means they have an outsized influence on the rest of the economy.\\n\\nWhile the country’s GDP figures were overly skewed by a multinational presence that repatriated profits and patent income, they are still a significant contributor to the country’s economy. An exodus of powerful foreign players, combined with the wider economic challenges of a trade war, are unlikely to boost many Irish residents’ chances of owning a home.\\n\\nIreland’s supply crisis\\n\\nInstead of a purge of the country’s prosperous multinational workers, most sides of the debate are in agreement that supply-side policies are the preferable means to addressing Ireland’s housing crisis.\\n\\nIreland’s housing market is struck by a supply glut, which exacerbates any demand-side issues presented by the country’s high-paid multinational employees.\\n\\nIn September, Ireland’s Central Bank that the country may need to build as many as 52,000 homes per year to cope with demand, a 20,000-home increase from the 2023 level.\\n\\n“As the threat of a trade war with the US looms, our reliance on certain sectors of the economy will come into sharp focus. The housing market is vulnerable to any economic headwinds, so it is imperative that the Government limits the impact if at all possible while also continuing to ramp up housing supply,” said\\n\\nIreland’s upcoming stormclouds pose a warning to other European cities with their own cohort of high-paid, Silicon Valley tech workers.\\n\\nZurich, home to an estimated 5,000 Google employees, also known as , is one of Europe’s most expensive housing markets.

On the other hand, contrarian investors view the indicator as a counterintuitive buying signal. After all, when the death cross flashes, plenty of bad news has already been baked into the security. Most recently, macroeconomic headwinds in the form of tariffs and a looming trade war have , with tech giants like Apple taking market beatings of ~15%.\\n\\nOne must conduct some statistical legwork to understand whether Apple’s death cross should be interpreted at face value. Sure enough, investors can view the negative intersection as a buying signal — but timing matters. Ultimately, I am bullish on AAPL stock and rate it as a Buy — but only under a particular technical strategy.\\n\\nLaying Out the Strategy for AAPL’s Death Cross\\n\\nWith a technical outlook, the Death Cross presents an opportunity for short-term trades to capitalize on a near-term rebound. Over the past decade, AAPL stock printed five death crosses: Aug 2015, Dec 2018, June 2022, Oct 2022, and March 14, 2024. Using TipRanks’ screener, investors can conduct their own statistical analysis. A key takeaway is that AAPL is down four times out of five a month after the flashing of the death cross.\\n\\nObviously, a contrarian success ratio of 20% is relatively poor. If you simply bought the death cross as a contrarian reflex, there’s statistically a good chance that your near-expiration long-side wager would fail. Instead, the bulls historically take their time digesting the bad news in AAPL stock. At the three-month mark, the contrarian success ratio following the death cross is 80% favorable for the optimist.\\n\\nWhat’s more, the average three-month return—including the one instance where AAPL was in the red—stands at 11.47%. If this metric were applied to Friday’s closing price of $188.38, the projected price three months out would be $209.99.\\n\\nWith that, I have the necessary ingredients to plot . Based on the historical response to the Death Cross, I’m assuming that AAPL stock will pop by double-digit percentage points in three months. By logical deduction, my target options chain will expire on July 18, and I will seek strategies with an upside target of $210.\\n\\nBigger Payouts With Added Risk\\n\\nAlternatively, speculators seeking a near-term espresso shot in AAPL stock may consider an aggressive options strategy called the bull call spread, specifically, . This transaction involves buying the $205 call option and simultaneously selling the $210 call. The proceeds from the short call partially offset the debit paid for the long call, resulting in a discounted net debit.\\n\\nFunctionally, the bull call spread allows market participants to modulate the interplay between risk-taking (or debit distribution) and risk underwriting (credit reception). Stated differently, you could theoretically just buy the $205 call outright, knowing that the death cross response will likely drive AAPL stock to $210 by expiration.\\n\\nHowever, a $205 call option on Apple is quite expensive, even if it’s out of the money. Selling a call would result in a premium, thus helping to defray some of the cost of the long call.\\n\\nOf course, the penalty of the bull call spread is that the sold call represents an obligation if it, too, goes into the money. Because you bought a call at a lower strike price, you cover this obligation. At the same time, if the target security screams higher, the reward is capped at the short strike price.\\n\\nOf course, one could elect an ultra-high short call within a bull spread strategy to extract maximum reward. The problem with this approach is that there’s a chance that the spread will fail to break even. If so, you risk losing the entire net debit paid. On the other side of the equation, too low of a short call may lead to leaving money on the table.\\n\\nI prefer the aforementioned because of the relatively small net debit required, combined with the arguably high probability of success. Ultimately, though, the choice of spread will come down to individual risk tolerance.\\n\\nIs Apple a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\\n\\nOn Wall Street, AAPL stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buy, 11 Hold, and 4 Sell ratings over the past three months. implies approximately 32% upside potential over the next twelve months.\\n\\nThe Smart Way to Capitalize on AAPL’s Death Cross\\n\\nApple is on the verge of flashing the death cross, a technical pattern in which the 50 DMA slips below the 200 DMA. Ordinarily, this indicator represents a major warning. However, for AAPL stock, it’s a contrarian signal, an opportunity to buy the equity. Nevertheless, timing this pattern is critical.\\n\\nStatistically, it’s better to avoid the one-month mark following the flashing of the death cross and instead target the three-month mark. By simple deduction, we calculate that there’s a solid chance AAPL stock could reach $210 at the July 18 expiration date. This speculation — and the confidence in this narrative — will ultimately dictate which specific options strategy to deploy.\",\n                \"finbert_score\": 58.82352239945355,\n                \"published_date\": \"Tue, 08 Apr 2025 08:04:00 GMT\",\n                \"publisher\": \"TipRanks\",\n                \"regions\": null,\n                \"score\": 42.55882002325619,\n                \"second_model_score\": 30,\n                \"sectors\": [\n                    \"Information Technology\"\n                ],\n                \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n                \"summary\": \"Apple stock recently triggered a \\\"Death Cross,\\\" a bearish indicator, but this article argues it presents a contrarian buying opportunity.

The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up 1.90%\\n\\nAll of the Magnificent 7 stocks took it on the chin yesterday, but Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the biggest loser, falling 5%, followed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dropping 4.9% and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 2.6%.\\n\\nSo far, though, trading shows the tech stocks pretty much shrugging off the latest announcement with the entire group except Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) moving higher in early trading.\\n\\nWhile Apple is obviously closely tied to the China trade, its stock swung from being down to moving up 3.11% heading into the morning bell. Tesla is up 4%, Amazon is 2% higher, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is jumping 4%\\n\\nApple could have most to lose\\n\\nApple has been scrambling to shift manufacturing away from China as quickly as possible and The Wall Street Journal reported it would be as it could to India.\\n\\nWhile India is also getting hit with new tariffs from Trump, at 27%, they are far more manageable than the doubling of rates China just got hit with. The iPhone, which makes up half of Apple’s revenue, is primarily sourced from China and the rising trade tensions that suddenly opened up into a “hot war” with tariffs has seen AAPL stock plummet. Shares are down 31% year-to-date, but they’ve lost 22% of their value in just the last week.\\n\\nTrump said yesterday he thinks the iPhone can be because “we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources” to do so. But such shifts can’t happen overnight and in fact take several years. Also, it would raise the cost of an iPhone due to the higher labor costs.\\n\\nWith China also imposing new export restrictions on rare earth minerals, manufacturing the iPhone domestically could become more difficult. Rare earth minerals are only a small fraction of the iPhone, but they play critical roles in its speakers, Taptic Engine, and color display. Apple, though, has moved to use 100% recycled rare earth elements in its smartphone.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.99983310699463,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:55:57 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://247wallst.com\",\n                \"title\": \"24/7 Wall St.\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"South Asia\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -64.99991655349731,\n            \"second_model_score\": -30.000000000000004,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Industrials\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Escalating trade tensions between the US and China are roiling the markets.

In the paper, he identified seven fundamental variables (earnings, return on equity, return on assets, accrual operating profitability to equity, cash operating profitability to assets, gross profit to assets and net payout ratio) that he combined into a single fundamental momentum measure. He showed that stocks in the top 20% of the universe according to that measure outperformed the market going forward.

Last night, a Tesla Supercharger cabinet exploded in Lacey, Washington, and authorities are suspecting it may have been caused by a bomb. The FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and local police are investigating the “malicious mischief.” The Supercharger station is currently shut down because the station that powers the stalls was severely damaged and is also missing a part.\\n\\nFollowing the ill-fated incident, Tesla commented on social media platform X about the situation, and requested the public to not “mess with critical infrastructure.” The suspected bombing is the latest in a series of attacks on Tesla, with the company’s stores, charging networks, and customer vehicles being damaged as a sign of protest against CEO Elon Musk. The billionaire’s close ties with President Trump and his role as head of the DOGE Committee have infuriated consumers both in the U.S. and abroad. The President, himself, has labeled such attacks as “domestic terrorism” and vowed to punish the offenders.\\n\\nTSLA Stock Is Hammered by Analysts’ Mixed Reviews\\n\\nWhile Tesla’s stores and charging networks are being literally bombed, TSLA stock is being hammered by mixed analyst reviews due to slumping auto sales and its tarnished brand image.\\n\\nYesterday, GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson reiterated a “Sell” rating on TSLA stock following the update on China EV registrations for the week of March 31 to April 6. According to the data, Tesla’s Chinese auto registrations plummeted by a massive 83% week-over-week, marking its largest drop in the key Chinese market. Given the significant decline, Johnson stated that “things appear to be worsening” for Tesla in its largest EV market.\\n\\nAt the same time, DBS analyst Elizabelle Pang cut the price target on TSLA stock from $300 to $275 (24% upside potential), while keeping a “Hold” rating. Pang cited several factors for the lowered price target and hold rating on Tesla. One of the most important reasons is that Tesla missed its Q1 delivery estimates by 11%, raising doubts on its future potential and leading to downward revisions in delivery expectations. Additionally, Tesla is losing ground in the Chinese EV market to domestic rival BYD (BYDDF), and concerns over the looming Chinese tariffs continue to dampen investor optimism.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas remains optimistic about Tesla’s future potential, which he believes will be driven largely by humanoid robots, autonomous driving, and other advanced systems. Jonas maintained his “Buy” rating on TSLA stock with a price target of $410, implying an impressive 84.8% upside potential. Overall, Jonas’ optimism stems from the belief that “the challenges facing Tesla’s current business are widely reported and well known, while the opportunities in the future business are potentially greatly underestimated.”\\n\\nIs Tesla Stock a Good Buy Now?\\n\\nOverall, TSLA stock has a Hold consensus rating on TipRanks, based on 16 Buys, 11 Holds, and 11 Sell ratings. Also, the average Tesla price target of $312.21 implies 40.7% upside potential from current levels.

Earlier this month, the American electric vehicle (EV) giant reported 336,681 cars delivered in Q1 2025, representing a 13% year-over-year decline from Q1 2024. The figure missed analyst expectations of 370,000 vehicles and prompted a and express concerns over “unprecedented brand damage.”\\n\\nStay Ahead of the Market:\\n\\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with\\n\\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using\\n\\nAs a result, I am bearish on TSLA and believe its stock will continue to underperform due to declines and non-core growth challenges.\\n\\nThe Musk Effect: When a CEO Becomes the Brand\\n\\nFollowing Elon Musk’s involvement in President Donald Trump’s campaign and administration, public perception of the enigmatic futurist has soured across the U.S. A recent poll showed that 36% of respondents have a “very unfavorable” opinion of him. Analysts agree that .\\n\\nUnlike Tesla, most consumers are unaware of who runs the company that manufactures their vehicle. Musk’s quirky persona and public visibility are a double-edged sword. People have been conditioned to think of Musk when they think of Tesla. Musk, in effect, is the Tesla brand, and now, many Americans wouldn’t dare purchase a Tesla because of Musk.\\n\\nRising Competition Erodes Tesla’s Market Position\\n\\nTesla’s problems did not begin (and will not end) with Elon Musk and his public image. Competition in the EV market is strengthening, with Tesla losing its leadership position in international markets like China. Aside from the political theatrics, the company’s bread-and-butter car production business is fading.\\n\\nFor instance, Chinese automaker BYD has now overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, thanks to outperformance in China. Tesla is also losing ground in European markets. In the E.U., data revealed Tesla’s new vehicle registrations dropped 40% year-over-year in February. Much of this can be attributed to Tesla’s hesitance, or inability, to manufacture an entry-level EV. BYD’s Dolphin Honor EV “Free” trim, for example, costs just $15,700 and offers a range of 261 miles–an offering that Tesla struggles to match with its $30,000+ offerings with a similar range.\\n\\nPerhaps most concerning is Tesla’s diminishing technological edge. While Tesla pioneered the modern EV, its competitors have caught up. For instance, Hyundai’s Ioniq 6 boosts an EPA-rated range of 361 miles and costs only $43,600. Tesla’s luxury appeal has diminished as well, and competitors like Mercedes, BMW, and Lucid (LCID) now match or exceed its premium offerings in range, charging speed, and interior quality.\\n\\nLastly, legacy automakers like Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) have aggressively expanded their EV lineups with models like the F-150 Lightning and Cadillac Lyriq. Both companies have loyal customers and extensive dealer networks. So, if any of their customers are tempted by an American EV, Tesla is no longer the leading option.\\n\\nPremium Price and Slowing Growth Raise Valuation Concerns\\n\\nThen there’s Tesla’s premium valuation. Tesla’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 117.5, implying sky-high growth expectations. Meanwhile, Tesla’s peers, like Toyota Motor (TM), trade at a P/E of 6.3. Moreover, Tesla’s high P/E is inconsistent with its growth. In 2024, revenues grew just 2% year-over-year.\\n\\nTo be fair, Tesla is not your average car company. Its autonomous driving technology, revenues from software services like “premium connectivity,” and diverse product offerings warrant a higher valuation than its strictly automotive peers. The question is, to what extent and for how long? In my view, any outperformance will be short-lived and brief.\\n\\nAmbitious But Unproven Future Horizons\\n\\nTesla’s vision for the future appears from a sci-fi novel: completely autonomous cars and humanoid robots. , Musk estimated that Tesla’s humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate “over $10 trillion in revenue long-term.” Musk plans to build thousands of humanoid robots this year.\\n\\nRemember that Musk is no stranger to lofty goals. In 2019, Musk was “very confident” that one million Tesla robotaxis would fill the streets by 2020. It’s safe to say that Tesla’s ambitions for Optimus should also be taken with a grain of salt. Tesla’s full self-driving (FSD) capability remains in beta testing with no clear timeline for regulatory approval.\\n\\nTesla’s energy storage business grew 67% despite these challenges in 2024. Its Megapack product line could eventually provide a meaningful revenue stream independent of vehicle sales. Still, Tesla’s energy storage business pales in comparison to its automotive segment.\\n\\nIs Tesla a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\\n\\nOn Wall Street, TSLA stock has a consensus rating of Hold based on 16 Buy, 11 Hold, and 11 Sell ratings over the past three months. implies ~30% upside potential over the next twelve months. Moreover, Tesla stock is rated as of 1.\\n\\nOn Monday, on TSLA from $550 to $315 per share, citing concerns that tariffs may accelerate the trend of Chinese consumers choosing domestic EV companies like BYD. Notably, over 20% of Tesla’s revenues are from China.\\n\\nChallenges Outweigh Opportunities\\n\\nTesla’s road ahead is challenging. Its EV market leadership showed signs of weakness even before its CEO decided to dive into political skullduggery. Musk’s political activities have undeniably caused brand damage, and the extent of the financial ramifications remains unclear.\\n\\nIn parallel, Tesla is dealing with intensifying competition at home and abroad, eroding technological advantage, and a premium valuation that is becoming harder to justify. Wall Street is clearly divided on Tesla’s prospects, and opportunities in robotics and autonomous driving remain distant. Until Tesla can address its brand perception issues and deliver meaningfully on one of its futuristic visions, I maintain a bearish outlook on the stock.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.99996423721313,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:27:43 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://finance.yahoo.com\",\n                \"title\": \"Yahoo Finance\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -79.99998211860657,\n            \"second_model_score\": -60,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Tesla stock is facing challenges due to declining sales, increasing competition, and concerns over Elon Musk's public image.

He argues that the recent decline in stock price and sales is overstated, given the short-term challenges and the upcoming growth prospects.\\n\\nAdditionally, Legg views the expected release of a new vehicle in the second quarter as a potential catalyst to drive up Tesla’s deliveries. Legg also pointed out that Tesla is less affected by new U.S. auto tariffs due to its North American production being mainly in California and Texas, giving it an advantage over other automakers.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Benchmark pointed out several risks, such as political pressure, an aging product lineup, and growing global competition.

The stock’s bounce came despite the S&P 500 and Dow both falling—making the rally even more unusual given how tightly Tesla has traded with the broader market since tariffs kicked in. But what really lit up investor chatter was the spat behind the scenes.\\n\\nMusk Clashes With White House Trade Voice\\n\\nNavarro, one of the architects of Trump’s aggressive tariff policy, appeared on CNBC this week and took a jab at Tesla’s global supply chain. He claimed Musk is “not a car manufacturer, he’s a car assembler,” pointing to Tesla’s international parts sourcing—something Navarro wants to curb under the administration’s America First strategy.\\n\\nMusk fired back fast. In a sharp post on X, he said, “Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false.” Musk also defended Tesla’s domestic footprint, pointing out that roughly 65% of the company’s components are U.S.- or Canada-sourced—enough to keep it ranked among the most American-made vehicles, according to Cars.com.\\n\\nTariff Turmoil Tests Tesla’s Staying Power\\n\\nTuesday’s wild price action reflected more than just social media drama. Tesla shares swung from $250.44 to $217.80, a nearly 13% intraday spread, before settling at $221.86—down 4.9% on the day. Since Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2, Tesla stock has dropped more than 21%. Investors are rattled by the potential cost hikes and global supply chain snarls that could hit Tesla harder than legacy automakers.\\n\\nMusk isn’t staying quiet. He said over the weekend that the U.S. and Europe “should not impose any tariffs on each other,” aligning himself with globalist manufacturing interests rather than Washington’s protectionist turn.\\n\\nBoth Musk and Navarro have the president’s ear, which means this feud could have real consequences. Navarro advises on trade. Musk co-leads DOGE, the group tasked with government efficiency. Their disagreement—especially in public—is a reminder of how unpredictable this tariff cycle could get for Tesla shareholders.\\n\\nIs Tesla a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\\n\\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on TSLA stock based on 16 Buys, 11 Holds, and 11 Sells assigned in the past three months. Furthermore, the average TSLA price target of $307.75 per share implies 38.7% upside potential.\\n\\nSee more TSLA analyst ratings\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 0.00692903995513916,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:40:26 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.tipranks.com\",\n                \"title\": \"TipRanks\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 0.00346451997756958,\n            \"second_model_score\": -5.551115123125783e-15,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n            \"summary\": \"Despite overall market dips, Tesla's stock rose 2.3% after a volatile day sparked by a public feud between Elon Musk and White House trade advisor Peter Navarro.

Amazon (AMZN+0.12%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.22%), and Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%) were also in the red. The renewed tariff war and surging yields have weighed heavily on growth names, reversing much of the sector’s 2025 momentum.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBond yields also surged, with the 30-year Treasury topping 4.75% — its highest since mid-February. “If Trump’s secret agenda is to crash the stock market to bring down long-term interest rates, the plan already failed,” economist Peter Schiff wrote on X. “The plan to crash the stock market is now crashing the bond market too.”\\n\\nDelta Air Lines plans to reduce capacity\\n\\nDelta kicked off the day with better-than-expected earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $0.46 versus the $0.38 expected by Wall Street. Adjusted revenue came in at $12.98 billion, matching forecasts, while net income jumped to $240 million, up from $37 million a year earlier. Shares rose more than 2% in premarket trading.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut while the headline numbers suggest resilience, Delta also said it plans to reduce flight capacity in the second quarter, signaling caution amid rising costs and shifting travel patterns. The airline cited the need to “restore operational reliability” and more tightly manage fuel and labor expenses.\\n\\nCracking a Corona — or cutting back? Constellation knows\\n\\nConstellation, the beverage giant behind Corona, Modelo, Kim Crawford, and Robert Mondavi, will report after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS of $2.27 on $2.12 billion in revenue. Watch for commentary on U.S. beer and wine sales — consumer staples that often shift in tone during periods of economic stress. Results could offer clues about household confidence as inflation lingers and real wages cool.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShifting retail signals from Walmart and Big Lots\\n\\nEarly Wednesday, Walmart said it was pulling its Q1 guidance due to uncertainty surrounding newly imposed Trump tariffs on Chinese goods, particularly electric vehicles and consumer electronics. The move underscores how trade policy is clouding visibility for even the most dominant U.S. retailers.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMeanwhile, Big Lots (BIG) also reports earnings today, though its place on the OTC market is a reminder of how far it’s fallen. Once a national discount heavyweight, Big Lots was delisted from the NYSE late last year and now trades as a penny stock. Its collapse adds to the growing wave of “retail wreckage” — from Red Lobster’s closures to Macy’s and Foot Locker (FL+0.79%), both of which are shuttering hundreds of stores across the country.\\n\\nTogether, these developments highlight the pressure facing retailers: rising input costs, unpredictable trade policy, and a consumer base increasingly cautious about spending.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBank earnings incoming\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -49.99997615814209,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:47:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://qz.com\",\n                \"title\": \"Quartz\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -37.499988079071045,\n            \"second_model_score\": -25,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Consumer Staples\",\n                \"Utilities\",\n                \"Industrials\",\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"The market is reacting to new US-China tariffs, particularly on Chinese EVs and tech, increasing economic uncertainty.

Among other things, it limits the amount of trading needed.\\n\\nMusk has often avoided commenting on tariffs, especially since coming to Washington as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\\n\\nBut he has long expressed his dissatisfaction with many aspects of the global trading system and barriers to trade that Trump has taken to calling non-monetary barriers.\\n\\nMusk has also pushed, as he put it in comments this past weekend, for \\\"zero-tariff\\\" systems between places like the US and Europe.\\n\\nTrump, by contrast, has long held tariffs in high regard in their own right and has rejected calls to focus on achieving zero-for-zero tariffs, instead saying other issues such as trade deficits need to change as well.\\n\\n\\\"No, it’s not,\\\" Trump said Monday afternoon when he was asked if Europe moving its tariffs on autos and industrial goods to zero was enough to reach a deal.\\n\\nAll of that marks a clear schism with Musk, who, confronted Trump about the tariff issues over the weekend. But he was unsuccessful in moving the president.\\n\\nAreas of agreement\\n\\nMusk has long commented on nuisances in trade in countries that he has said hurt his businesses.\\n\\nFor example, Musk has posted multiple times in recent years about local value-added taxes (VATs) and the impact they have on the varying prices of Tesla cars.\\n\\n\\\"Prices in the US (of all goods) don't include VAT, but it's usually included in other countries,\\\" in 2021 about selling EVs overseas.\\n\\nTrump has also made non-tariff barriers central to his pitch for trade fairness and often lists VATs first.\\n\\n\\\"For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff,\\\" Trump noted on .\\n\\nMusk has also made posts approving of taking on unfair trading practices.\\n\\n\\\"Good points,\\\" he posted in response to an administration list of \\\"10 unfair trade practices faced by American exporters.\\\"\\n\\nLarger areas of disagreement\\n\\nBut Musk clearly views the areas of disagreement as more pressing now that Trump’s historic \\\"Liberation Day\\\" plans have been unveiled.\\n\\nMusk’s flurry of insults Tuesday followed other posts in recent days that also critiqued Navarro in less blunt terms, including a video of Milton Friedman .\\n\\nA close ally of Musk who sits on the boards of Tesla and SpaceX has been even more vocal on the specifics of the tariff issue: his brother Kimbal.\\n\\n\\\"Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,\\\" Kimbal , calling Trump the \\\"most high tax American President in generations.\\\"\\n\\nKimbal often amplifies his brother's views and has posted repeatedly and pointedly about tariffs in recent days.\\n\\nTesla itself has also sent an , warning that tariffs could lead to retaliation from US export partners and higher prices for parts that can only be sourced internationally.\\n\\nMusk has offered a similar message.\\n\\n\\\"I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,\\\" Musk told Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini virtually at a meeting of Italy's League Party over the weekend.\\n\\nIn fact, at one point in 2018 — long before they teamed up — Musk on tariffs during his first term by saying, \\\"I am against import duties in general,\\\" as he also agreed with Trump's general objection at the time to foreign duties on cars.\\n\\nThis time around, Trump has already moved forward with a 25% tariff on foreign-made cars and auto parts.

Let’s take a look at how THOR Industries (NYSE:THO) and the rest of the automobile manufacturing stocks fared in Q4.\\n\\nMuch capital investment and technical know-how are needed to manufacture functional, safe, and aesthetically pleasing automobiles for the mass market. Barriers to entry are therefore high, and auto manufacturers with economies of scale can boast strong economic moats. However, this doesn’t insulate them from new entrants, as electric vehicles (EVs) have entered the market and are upending it. This has forced established manufacturers to not only contend with emerging EV-first competitors but also decide how much they want to invest in these disruptive technologies, which will likely cannibalize their legacy offerings.\\n\\nThe 7 automobile manufacturing stocks we track reported a strong Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 6.1%.\\n\\nAmidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 21.9% since the latest earnings results.\\n\\nTHOR Industries (NYSE:THO)\\n\\nCreated through the acquisition and merger of various RV manufacturers, THOR Industries manufactures and sells a range of recreational vehicles, including motorhomes and travel trailers, catering to consumers seeking the freedom and comfort of the RV lifestyle.\\n\\nTHOR Industries reported revenues of $2.02 billion, down 8.6% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.1%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a slower quarter for the company with a significant miss of analysts’ adjusted operating income estimates.\\n\\n“At the beginning of fiscal 2025, we foresaw that the first half of our fiscal year would be challenging and that certainly has proven to be accurate. Our focus on maintaining a healthy balance between wholesale and retail activity enabled our segments to hold margins reasonably well with consolidated gross margins for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 at 12.1% compared to 12.3% for the prior-year period. As we anticipated and messaged at the beginning of our fiscal year, our North American Motorized and European segments have both seen a year-over-year decline in gross margins while our North American Towable segment has seen meaningful improvement on a year-over-year basis, with gross margins up 370 basis points over the same quarter last year. Our consolidated margin this quarter was also impacted by actions we took to deepen our partnerships with key dealers. Strategically, deepening these key relationships is important to our long-term market position. These strategic decisions position THOR well as we look ahead. The takeaway for this quarter and for the first half of our fiscal year is that we performed as we expected,” said Todd Woelfer, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.\\n\\nThe stock is down 32% since reporting and currently trades at $64.83.\\n\\n.\\n\\nBest Q4: Ford (NYSE:F)\\n\\nEstablished to make automobiles accessible to a broader segment of the population, Ford (NYSE:F) designs, manufactures, and sells a variety of automobiles, trucks, and electric vehicles.\\n\\nFord reported revenues of $48.21 billion, up 4.9% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 5.5%. The business had a stunning quarter with a solid beat of analysts’ sales volume and EBITDA estimates.\\n\\nThe stock is down 12.3% since reporting. It currently trades at $8.77.\\n\\nIs now the time to buy Ford? .\\n\\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\\n\\nOriginally founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle company accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy.\\n\\nTesla reported revenues of $25.71 billion, up 2.1% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 6%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts’ operating income and EPS estimates.\\n\\nTesla delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 40.6% since the results and currently trades at $230.65.\\n\\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM)\\n\\nFounded in 1908 by William C. Durant, General Motors (NYSE:GM) offers a range of vehicles and automobiles through brands such as Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac.\\n\\nGeneral Motors reported revenues of $47.7 billion, up 11% year on year. This result beat analysts’ expectations by 8%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter as it also produced an impressive beat of analysts’ sales volume estimates and full-year EPS guidance exceeding analysts’ expectations.\\n\\nThe stock is down 22.2% since reporting and currently trades at $42.83.\\n\\nLucid (NASDAQ:LCID)\\n\\nFounded by a former Tesla Vice President, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) designs, manufactures, and sells luxury electric vehicles with long-range capabilities.\\n\\nLucid reported revenues of $234.5 million, up 49.2% year on year. This print topped analysts’ expectations by 10.8%. It was an exceptional quarter as it also logged an impressive beat of analysts’ sales volume and EPS estimates.\\n\\nLucid delivered the fastest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is down 10% since reporting and currently trades at $2.35.\\n\\nMarket Update\\n\\nThe Fed’s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election. Still, questions remain about the direction of economic policy, as potential tariffs and corporate tax changes add uncertainty for 2025.\\n\\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

Traders wagering that the ETF would fall have so far accumulated paper profits of more than $6.1 billion this month, per an S3 report Tuesday.\\n\\nShorts stand to benefit from the wild intraday swings that erased trillions of dollars of market value, though it will ultimately depend on when they cash out on their wagers. With another $46 billion of new short bets made in April, according to S3, there’s a risk those contrarian wagers further amplify the next big shift in the market, especially if current weakness reverses and sends the major indexes higher.\\n\\n“Overall, the short side was an extraordinarily profitable trade up and down the market during this correction,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3, wrote. “81% of every short trade was profitable and 97% of every dollar shorted was a profitable trade.”\\n\\nOther contrarian bets that netted shorts the most gains include Apple Inc. (AAPL), Nvidia Corp (NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA). The Invesco QQQ Trust Series, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) Index, rounds out the top five most-profitable short trades so far in April. Each of the top five has so far netted paper profits of more than $2 billion for short sellers.\\n\\nMost of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks are included in the list of most profitable shorts so far in April. Meta Platforms Inc (META), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are also in the top fifteen. Outside of Nvidia, shorts have made solid bets that share prices of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. would decline.\\n\\nTotal short interest, or the dollar amount of total shares sold short, decreased by $114 billion — in part due to falling equity prices. In the event of a market rebound, short sellers will likely exit their negative positions by buying back shares, which could boost upside momentum for the overall market.\\n\\n“When the market hits a floor and starts trending upwards again, we should expect a slew of buy-to-covers as the mark-to-market increase of shares shorted creates a short side over-exposure in hedged portfolios and short sellers look to realize their mark-to-market gains,” said Dusaniwsky. “Short sellers will be shoulder to shoulder with momentum and FOMO traders buying into a future rally, exacerbating market volatility on the way up as they did on the way down.”\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 0,\n            \"published_date\": \"Thu, 10 Apr 2025 09:11:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": \"Bloomberg\",\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 0,\n            \"second_model_score\": 0,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Communication Services\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n            \"summary\": \"Short sellers profited immensely, gaining $159 billion in six days, as the US stock market plunged due to trade war fears.

That comes after a 10% baseline tariff for most US trading partners took effect Saturday.\\n\\nThe moves raise tariffs to their highest level in more than a century.\\n\\nChina announced retaliatory measures at 7 p.m. Beijing time, raising tariffs on US goods from 34% to 84% from April 10, according to a statement.\\n\\nTreasuries extended their selloff, with 30-year yields soaring briefly above 5%, and Asian shares and European shares fell in Wednesday trading. US futures fell sharply after China announced retaliation. Markets had remained volatile throughout the US day Tuesday, rallying as Trump previewed negotiations with South Korea, then reversing as the administration affirmed plans to move ahead with its massive China tariffs.\\n\\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.​​​​​​\\n\\nAsian countries are bearing the brunt of the measures, with Cambodia facing 49% and Vietnam 46%. Imports from the European Union will be taxed at a 20% rate.\\n\\n“The tariffs are on and the money is pouring in at a level that we’ve never seen before, and it’s going to be great for us. It’s going to be great for other countries. We’ve been ripped off and abused by countries for many years,” Trump said Tuesday at a White House event.\\n\\nIn the hours before implementation — at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday in Washington — the White House insisted the duties were indeed coming, squelching market speculation for any last-minute reprieve.\\n\\nUS levies on China now include previous 20% levies tied to fentanyl trafficking, a 34% “reciprocal” tariff derived from a calculation based on the bilateral trade balance, and an additional 50% duty Trump announced after Beijing said it would respond by taxing US exports to China.\\n\\nThe president welcomed appeals from US allies who want him to lower their rates, saying Tuesday that teams from Japan and South Korea were en route to hammer out agreements. Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week for talks, while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will travel to Washington next week.\\n\\n“We’re doing very well in making, I call them tailored deals, not off-the-rack,” Trump said. “It’s been amazing what’s happened. Sometimes you have to mix it up a little bit.”\\n\\nStill, risks to the world economy abound with Trump’s approach.\\n\\nChina has been defiant in the face of Trump’s tariffs, declaring plans to “fight to the end.” The escalation in tensions makes any imminent call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping less likely and the latest comments raised the risk of a prolonged trade war between the world’s two largest economies.\\n\\nXi’s No. 2, Li Qiang, said his country has ample policy tools to “fully offset” any negative external shocks in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.\\n\\nOther economic powers are striking back as well. In Canada, a 25% counter-tariff to the auto tariffs Trump imposed on his northern neighbor last week also took effect a minute after midnight. In Europe, both France and Germany are pushing for a tougher response.\\n\\nThe White House has been on defense since last week when Trump unveiled his latest tariff plan. Trump argues that the taxes will boost US prosperity and revive domestic manufacturing, but his approach has drawn criticism from Wall Street, economists and some in Trump’s own party, who have questioned the administration’s methodology and warned of an economic fallout that could include higher consumer prices and slower growth, if not a recession.\\n\\n“Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?” Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican facing a competitive reelection race next year, asked during a congressional hearing Tuesday. He was one of a number of lawmakers voicing anxiety as constituents see their retirement funds fluctuate.\\n\\nSpeaking to US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Tillis also asked if voters will feel results from the tariffs in about a year. “I wish you well, but I am skeptical,” he said.\\n\\nGreer told lawmakers: “We will have the president’s plan going into effect and we’re coupling that with immediate negotiations with our partners.”\\n\\nSince Trump’s announcement, the administration has offered mixed messages on the path forward. Some have said the tariffs will unlock talks that see other countries lower barriers on US exports, and perhaps result in Trump reducing his rates as well. But White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has repeatedly pushed back on the notion Trump is merely using tariffs as a negotiating tool.\\n\\nFor Trump, who has long argued for tariffs as a solution for his trade grievances, this plan will reassert US power, revive domestic manufacturing and extract geopolitical concessions.\\n\\nUrgent Diplomacy\\n\\nAffected nations were rushing to win better terms and weighing their responses ahead of the April 9 deadline, while grappling with a process that many described as chaotic and opaque.\\n\\nA top Vietnamese official visited Washington for last-minute meetings seeking to blunt one of the highest tariff rates applied on any US partner. The nation has been engaging in urgent diplomacy and its representatives have conveyed to Trump administration officials that it is working to address a trade imbalance.\\n\\nTrump said Tuesday he spoke with the South Korean interim leader Han Duck-soo “about their tremendous and unsustainable Surplus, Tariffs, Shipbuilding” and “large scale purchase” of US liquid natural gas. He also discussed “their joint venture in an Alaska Pipeline, and payment for the big time Military Protection we provide to South Korea.”\\n\\nThe US president described the discussion as a “great call” and posted on social media that “things are looking good.” South Korea said it’s seeking to cut a “big” trade deal with Washington, and that top commerce officials from both sides will handle detailed negotiations.\\n\\nJapan sent senior officials to Washington to lay the groundwork for tariff negotiations, following a call on Monday between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. On Wednesday, ministers kept urging the US to review its tariffs while a plunge in stocks and bonds prompted officials from the central bank and the finance ministry to hold a meeting to soothe frayed nerves.\\n\\nEU officials were working on next steps after the US president rejected a proposal to drop tariffs on bilateral trade in industrial goods, saying Monday that it was not enough to reset the trading relationship.\\n\\nWall Street\\n\\nA series of Wall Street executives criticized the plan this week, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who in his annual shareholder letter Monday called for a quick resolution to trade policy uncertainty and warned against a potentially “disastrous” fragmentation of America’s long-term economic alliances.\\n\\nAlso expressing concerns in a litany of social media posts was Bill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management and a Trump supporter. He later said he was supportive of the tariff strategy, but called for a pause before the reciprocal duties took effect.\\n\\nWhile Trump’s aides have offered a chorus of support for the tariffs, some tensions among his team have started to show. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who advises Trump, called Navarro a “moron” in a social media post after Navarro called him a “car assembler” rather than a car manufacturer. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the clash, saying “boys will be boys.”\\n\\n232.69\\n\\n-\\n\\n+(4.88%)\\n\\nAs of 12:31:59 PM EDT. Market Open.\\n\\nTrump, undaunted, is planning more.\\n\\nLong-promised tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs will be announced “very shortly,” he told Republicans in Washington Tuesday. Other threatened sectoral tariffs include on lumber and semiconductor chips.\\n\\nAnd Trump is set to further escalate his trade war with China in the coming months, with the White House announcing late Tuesday a plan to increase planned tariffs even further on small parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong that had previously been exempt from taxes.\\n\\nAll of this, the president and his administration have repeatedly promised, will lead to a future boom, both economically for the US and politically for his party.\\n\\n“We’re going to win the midterm elections, and we’re going to have a tremendous, thundering landslide,” Trump told Republican lawmakers and donors Tuesday. “I really believe that.”\\n\\n—With assistance from Laura Davison, Malcolm Scott, Jennifer A.

In the ensuing lawsuit filed by investors when a bid failed to materialise, tense text messages between Musk and al-Rumayyan were made public.\\n\\nIn the following years, Musk missed out on the billions Riyadh has poured into its Vision 2030 programme to diversify the economy away from oil. The kingdom is investing an estimated $39 billion in developing the EV sector, according to a 2024 report by consultants PwC.\\n\\nTesla's Saudi debut also lags that of Chinese giant BYD, which opened its Riyadh showroom in May 2024.\\n\\nCHALLENGES\\n\\nNow Tesla has arrived in Saudi Arabia, it faces a number of challenges - even if one of them is unlikely to be the angry protests against Musk's politics that have recently dogged its operations in Europe and the United States.\\n\\nThese include the paucity of charging stations and summer temperatures that can top 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), draining EV batteries more rapidly.\\n\\nAs of 2024, Saudi Arabia had just 101 EV charging stations, compared with 261 in neighbouring United Arab Emirates, a country with a third the population, data from Statista based on Electromaps showed.\\n\\nMost are in major cities, making long journeys across desert highways unfeasible.\\n\\n\\\"I think charging is probably one of the main, if not the main, point of concern,\\\" said Carlos Montenegro, BYD's general manager in Saudi Arabia, adding Saudi drivers clock up many more kilometres each year than in other markets.\\n\\nAround 70% of the cars BYD sells in Saudi Arabia are hybrids rather than pure EVs, Montenegro said.\\n\\nFahd Abdulrahman, a Saudi browsing at BYD's Riyadh showroom, said driving range was his major concern about buying an EV.\\n\\n\\\"I drive a lot, my average is more than 50,000 km (per year). I am afraid that an EV would not serve for that.\\\"\\n\\nYet Riyadh has massive development plans, which include a goal of 30% EV adoption by 2030.\\n\\nIt has formed the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Company, which aims to boost the number of chargers to 5,000 by 2030, 50 times the current number.\\n\\n\\\"EV adoption (in Saudi Arabia) will likely remain below leading countries, such as China, but could still see growth in the coming years,\\\" said Seth Goldstein, equity strategist at Morningstar. \\\"I see growing EV demand as more fast chargers are built and affordable long-range EVs enter the market.\\\"\\n\\n(Reporting by Pesha Magid in Riyadh and Manya Saini in Dubai.

With AMD’s considerable exposure to Chinese markets and reliance on third-party manufacturing, mainly through Taiwan Semiconductor , the market remains concerned about the potential impact of tariffs on the company.\\n\\nTariffs Threaten Semiconductor Supply Chains\\n\\nAt the center of this decline is a policy shift from President Donald Trump’s administration. Last week, Trump introduced , targeting a long list of U.S. trading partners. While semiconductors are exempted, the relief may only be temporary.\\n\\nAdding to the pressure, tariffs were levied on wafer fabrication equipment imported into the U.S. While AMD relies on Taiwan Semiconductor for manufacturing, the ripple effect of these tariffs could still impact its bottom line.\\n\\nAMD is at a disadvantage compared to its larger rival, Nvidia . Unlike Nvidia, which reported an adjusted gross margin of , AMD’s margin . This significant margin gap provides a thinner cushion to AMD and limits its ability to absorb cost increases without eating into profits.\\n\\nAMD’s China Exposure Presents a Major Risk\\n\\nFurther, China's role in AMD’s business is important. AMD reported revenue of $6.23 billion from China (including Hong Kong) in 2024, about 24.2% of its total sales. Thus, a retaliatory tariff from China on American technology products would make AMD’s chips more expensive for Chinese buyers, potentially hampering its competitiveness in one of its most important markets.\\n\\nWall Street has begun recalibrating expectations. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh recently from “Buy” to “Hold,” citing uncertainty around its business in China and concerns over margin sustainability. This has deepened investor skepticism, especially with AMD lagging behind Nvidia in several key performance metrics.\\n\\nAMD’s Growth Drivers Still Intact\\n\\nYet, it’s not all doom and gloom. AMD’s core business remains strong, and the company continues to show impressive growth in areas critical to its long-term strategy, particularly in data centers and AI. In 2024, AMD reported from its data center segment, marking a 94% year-over-year increase. This was primarily driven by surging demand for its Instinct MI300X GPUs.\\n\\nThe company is also moving aggressively to cement its place in the AI ecosystem. Its marks a strategic move to enhance its in-house AI development capabilities. With this acquisition, AMD aims to deliver high-performance AI models optimized for its hardware architecture.\\n\\nOn the product side, AMD is rolling out an ambitious lineup. The MI325X GPUs are , and the company is already laying the groundwork for its next-generation MI350 series. These GPUs are expected to deliver significant performance and energy efficiency. Looking further, AMD has its eyes set on the MI400 series. It's also investing heavily in ROCm, its open software platform.\\n\\nAMD Stock’s Valuation\\n\\nWhile analysts have a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating on AMD stock, the recent price drop may represent a value opportunity for long-term investors. With a forward , AMD appears attractively priced, especially given its double-digit earnings growth potential.\\n\\nFor instance, analysts expect AMD to post in 2025, up 47.7% year-over-year. AMD’s bottom line is projected to increase 36.2% in FY26.\\n\\nHowever, AMD’s valuation becomes less compelling when compared to Nvidia, which trades at a slightly higher but commands superior margins, has a leading market share in the AI space, and is well-placed to navigate macroeconomic shocks.\\n\\nConclusion: Bargain or Value Trap?\\n\\nUltimately, while AMD’s stock has become cheaper and its long-term potential remains intact, its short-term outlook remains clouded by geopolitical risks and competitive pressures. Thus, investors looking for a stock in the semiconductor space may find Nvidia to be a more appealing option.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The world's largest chip producer already controls two-thirds of the foundry market, according to TrendForce. Moreover, with (AI) demand growing at a rapid clip, the need for the chips it produces only continues to rise.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the healthy state of TSMC's business did not prevent a 35% drop in the stock price since January. However, with industry leadership and a diverse and desired client base, the short-term forces hammering TSMC stock are more likely a buying opportunity than a sign of a longer-term decline, and here's why.\\n\\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now.\\n\\nThe state of TSMC\\n\\nOther than TSMC's equipment maker ASML, few other AI stocks are in a stronger position. As the world's most advanced chipmaker, its clients are top chip design companies, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and Apple.\\n\\nThis market strength has unfortunately not stopped TSMC stock from falling. Geopolitical tensions with neighboring China are on the rise, and some investors fear for the future of the company should China invade the island. Also, investors fear the effect of tariffs on the company despite the Trump administration exempting semiconductors.\\n\\nNonetheless, TSMC seems to only extend its dominance, which makes its stock attractive with its lower price. TSMC's foundry market share grew more than 2 percentage points to 67% between the third and fourth quarters of 2024.\\n\\nAccording to multiple reports, TSMC has also entered into a joint venture with Intel, the largest chip manufacturer in the U.S. This agreement could potentially offer tremendous benefits to both companies. With the move, TSMC diversifies its manufacturing base away from the geopolitical risks it faces in Taiwan. Additionally, manufacturing in the U.S. blunts the effects of possible U.S. tariffs and pacifies Intel, which had begun to emerge as a potential competitor.\\n\\nFinancials remain strong\\n\\nDespite the recent drop in the stock price, TSMC's financial performance should make it more attractive to buyers over the long term. In 2024, revenue of $90 billion rose by 34% from year-ago levels. With that increase, gross margin rose by 2 percentage points to 56%, a testament to the company's rising efficiency.\\n\\nAdditionally, operating expenses dropped slightly as a percentage of revenue. That led to a comprehensive income of more than $39 billion, a 50% increase from year-ago levels.\\n\\nStill, staying on top of demand and increasing its market share requires the company to invest heavily in building and maintaining foundries. Thus, it spent almost $30 billion in 2024 on property and equipment, just slightly less than it spent in 2023. Between rising demand for the most advanced semiconductors and the push to build more foundries in the U.S., investors should expect that level of spending to continue.\\n\\nHowever, investors may find it easier to overlook those high fixed costs amid a lower valuation. TSMC's had exceeded 30 as recently as January. Today, its earnings multiple has fallen to just 21, and the of 16 indicates its rapid profit growth is likely to continue.\\n\\nConsider TSMC stock\\n\\nTSMC has become the dominant company in semiconductor manufacturing, and the deep discount in the stock price amid the stock sell-off makes it an even better buy.\\n\\nInvesting in TSMC does bring some degree of geopolitical risk, particularly with rising trade tensions. Nonetheless, virtually all top chip companies turn to TSMC to meet their manufacturing needs. Additionally, its new partnership with Intel addresses some of the geopolitical risks while turning a potential competitor into a partner.\\n\\nConsidering that investors can now buy this at a heavily discounted valuation, it has become an opportune time to buy shares.\\n\\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\\n\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\\n\\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\\n\\nNvidia:if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009,you’d have $244,570!*\\n\\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $35,715!*\\n\\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $461,558!*\\n\\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\\n\\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 5, 2025\\n\\nhas positions in Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Qualcomm.

This news comes at a time of significant market volatility, driven in part by concerns over potential global tariffs, which have seen Intel’s stock price pull back sharply to around $19.30 in early April.\\n\\nThe buzz surrounding a strategic tie-up with TSMC presents a potentially transformative catalyst for Intel, prompting investors to consider whether current market fears are overshadowing a fundamental development that could reshape the company’s future.\\n\\nBuilding Blocks: Progress Paves the Way for Strategic Moves\\n\\nThe potential partnership with TSMC is not entirely unexpected, especially given Intel’s recent progress under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm on March 18. Tan, a respected figure in the semiconductor industry, has instilled a renewed sense of investor confidence. Additionally, Intel has recently begun risk production for its 18A process node, indicating that its advanced manufacturing technology is nearing commercialization. This progress suggests that Intel was already taking steps to improve its position before the partnership rumors surfaced, making it a more attractive collaborator for TSMC.\\n\\nThe Proposed Alliance: A Potential Turning Point\\n\\nRecent reports indicate that Intel and TSMC have explored a preliminary agreement to form a joint venture that would operate Intel’s semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the United States. Under this unconfirmed proposal, TSMC would acquire a significant minority stake—reportedly around 20%—in the new entity. This potential alliance is reportedly encouraged by U.S. government officials who aim to strengthen the domestic supply chain for advanced semiconductors.\\n\\nA partnership with TSMC could provide Intel with access to the world’s leading operational expertise in high-volume, cutting-edge chip production. This collaboration would significantly accelerate improvements in Intel Foundry Services (IFS), enhancing manufacturing yields, operational efficiencies, and overall service quality. Furthermore, housing critical TSMC-backed operations on U.S. soil would align with geopolitical goals to diversify semiconductor production away from East Asia, potentially unlocking further government incentives.\\n\\nBuy Signal Flashing? Why Intel Looks Attractive After the Pullback\\n\\nDespite the recent decline in Intel’s stock price, which has dropped to its 52-week low of $18.51, analysts see potential for recovery. The stock’s valuation metrics have been compressed, with a price-to-sales ratio of 1.56 and a price-to-book ratio of 0.79, indicating that the stock is trading below the stated value of its assets. This often signals market pessimism and potential undervaluation.\\n\\nCurrently, Intel has received a consensus rating of “Reduce” from analysts, but the average price target stands at $25.58, suggesting a potential upside of approximately 34% from current levels. This discrepancy between the current price and the potential value may present an opportunity for investors focused on fundamentals and strategic catalysts.\\n\\nA Defining Moment for Investors\\n\\nIntel is navigating a critical juncture in its history. While external market fears have weighed heavily on the stock, the company’s operational progress and strategic ambitions suggest a different narrative is unfolding beneath the surface. Key updates are expected in the upcoming Q1 earnings report on April 24 and the Foundry Direct Connect event on April 29, which will provide investors with clearer insights into whether Intel’s turnaround efforts are gaining real traction.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the potential partnership with TSMC could be a game changer for Intel, offering the company a path to regain its competitive edge in the semiconductor industry. As the market continues to react to external pressures, investors should keep a close eye on Intel’s developments, as they may signal a significant shift in the company’s trajectory.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 58.823501362520105,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:10:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.apnakal.com\",\n                \"title\": \"apnakal.com\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 39.617633034201226,\n            \"second_model_score\": 24.11764705882353,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Industrials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Intel's stock price has declined amid market volatility and global tariff concerns.

The extreme volatility has made every trade feel unpredictable, with positive and negative news about global equities swinging wildly in both directions. But amid all this chaos, Apple’s (AAPL) stock has erased its gains from the past twelve months. That’s pretty unusual for a stock of Apple’s size and stability.\\n\\nNo other company seems to be more in the crosshairs of this tariff storm than Cupertino’s finest. Only about 5% of Apple’s major suppliers are based in the U.S., which leaves it heavily reliant on overseas production and imports. With tariffs pushing up production costs almost overnight, some of Apple’s core products could see prices double. This is a massive, unprecedented challenge that no analyst could have predicted at this scale.\\n\\nGiven the chaotic situation in the U.S. tech sector, Apple is facing serious structural headwinds. For me, this doesn’t feel like an overreaction, even though the stock is down nearly 30% this year. With the current state of tariffs, I’m rating Apple as a Sell. The long-term outlook is uncertain depending on how the tariffs are resolved, and there’s a real chance the stock could drop even more.\\n\\nTariff Storm Puts AAPL at Greatest Risk\\n\\nWhile trade tariffs can bring more revenue into government coffers over time, they also destroy economic value by reducing trade volumes, especially in the short to medium term. Raising costs for foreign suppliers to do business with the U.S. might “encourage” them to set up factories in the U.S. But this pressure on suppliers doesn’t automatically lead to that outcome—it depends on a range of factors.\\n\\nNow, let’s consider Apple in this context. The company has 36% of its supplier facilities in Southeast Asia and India, 33% in Mainland China, 10% in Taiwan, 9% in Japan, 5% in Europe and the U.S., and just 1% in Latin America. In other words, 95% of Apple’s product manufacturing occurs overseas. Currently, a third of Apple’s suppliers are subject to a massive 104% tariff on goods from Mainland China, not to mention the additional tariffs imposed on production in every other country where Apple has manufacturing facilities.\\n\\nSpeaking of China, let’s rewind to between 2018 and 2019 when the U.S.-China trade war was in full swing under the Trump administration. At that time, Apple was trying to find ways to reduce its reliance on China, where nearly half of its biggest suppliers were based. Fast-forward more than five years, and 33% of Apple’s suppliers are still in Mainland China.\\n\\nIn short, this shows how complex and time-consuming it is—even for a company as large and influential as Apple—to reshape its supply chain. The big question is whether Apple can soften the tariff impact without hiking prices on its flagship products like the iPhone, Mac and AirPods. For now, the near-term future for Apple’s sales is bleak.\\n\\nEven Apple’s Strongest Bulls Are Concerned\\n\\nIn my opinion, Apple cannot dodge the tariff bullet without taking a major hit to its business. Apple’s supply chain is one of the most complex in the world, and the company’s ability to distribute its suppliers globally is the only reason it can offer an iPhone 16 for $799.\\n\\nNow, imagine Apple trying to shift its most prominent suppliers to the U.S. First, there are some huge problems. The biggest one is that unemployment in the U.S. is very low at 4.2%, which means the country would need a complete overhaul of its labor market to accommodate this shift. The second issue is that, unlike countries like Mexico and India, where manufacturing workers earn around $6,500 and $4,000 a year, the average wage in the U.S. is around $40,000.\\n\\nEven Dan Ives, a long-time Apple bull at Wedbush, is concerned. Although he maintains a positive outlook, he lowered his price target from $325 to $250. Ives believes that if Apple were to manufacture in the U.S., iPhones could cost as much as $3,500.\\n\\nConsidering that iPhones are the core of Apple’s ecosystem, such a drastic price increase would severely impact iPhone sales and the company’s high-margin Services business, which has been a significant growth driver in recent years.\\n\\nConsidering Different Scenarios for Apple\\n\\nTo better understand the trade war’s potential impact on Apple’s business, let’s consider a hypothetical scenario where China negotiates to ease the impact of the export tariffs. Suppose China backs down and agrees that iPhones can be manufactured in the U.S. under the same terms. However, would China then ban using iPhones and other Apple products within the country? The answer is, quite possibly.\\n\\nIf that were the case, it could lead to a significant loss for Apple. On average, around 30 million to 35 million iPhones are shipped to China annually, each selling for approximately $1,000. That’s about $35 billion in potential lost sales for Apple in the region. In fact, in FY 2024, Greater China accounted for $67 billion in sales, making up 17% of Apple’s total revenue for the year. This figure could decline substantially in the coming years.\\n\\nOn a more optimistic note, as , there’s some hope for Apple in the way consumers buy iPhones. Most people around the world still purchase their iPhones on installment plans. So, while a 15% to 20% price increase would likely hurt demand, the silver lining is that Apple may be somewhat insulated from these challenges. With installment plans, consumers can spread out the price hikes over two or three years, making the higher costs more digestible.\\n\\nIs Apple a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\\n\\nDespite the tariff debacle, several analysts have lowered their price targets on Apple stock, but only one has downgraded Apple to a Sell since the beginning of April. Out of the 33 analysts covering the stock in the past three months, 17 have a Buy rating, 12 rate the stock as Hold, and four have a Sell rating. The average price target is $242.61, which suggests a 36% upside potential from the current price.\\n\\nPatience is a Virtue With AAPL Stock\\n\\nFor long-term Apple shareholders, the key to deciding when to sell or trim positions lies in structural changes that disrupt the company’s investment thesis—a rare scenario for a company of Apple’s size. The ongoing trade war and the imposition of import tariffs, particularly those affecting China, could significantly impact Apple’s long-term outlook if these tariffs remain in place.\\n\\nHigher costs will probably lead to lower demand, especially for key products in Apple’s ecosystem, which could delay the company’s AI supercycle and even affect its Services business. In other words, this is a game changer — and not in winning way for AAPL shareholders. Given this scenario, and with the Trump administration struggling to negotiate better terms with key countries in Apple’s supply chain, I expect further losses ahead, with Apple likely underperforming the broader market.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.99961853027344,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:02:22 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.tipranks.com\",\n                \"title\": \"TipRanks\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"South Asia\",\n                \"Latin America & Caribbean\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -79.99980926513672,\n            \"second_model_score\": -60,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Apple's stock has suffered significantly due to the ongoing tariff situation, erasing its gains from the past year.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 28% share price drop in the last month. To make matters worse, the recent drop has wiped out a year's worth of gains with the share price now back where it started a year ago.\\n\\nEven after such a large drop in price, given close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or \\\"P/E's\\\") below 15x, you may still consider Apple as a stock to avoid entirely with its 26.9x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\\n\\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\\n\\nApple could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\\n\\nKeen to find out how analysts think Apple's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start .\\n\\nHow Is Apple's Growth Trending?\\n\\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Apple would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.\\n\\nTaking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 2.0%. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 5.4% in total. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\\n\\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 15% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 11% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.\\n\\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Apple's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.\\n\\nThe Key Takeaway\\n\\nEven after such a strong price drop, Apple's P/E still exceeds the rest of the market significantly. We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\\n\\nAs we suspected, our examination of Apple's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\\n\\nIt's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Apple , and understanding should be part of your investment process.\\n\\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks in focus.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump’s new tariff regimes have been introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. A 10% tariff was imposed on nearly all countries and territories this Saturday, with rates expected to escalate higher and become even more individualized for the “worst” offenders. In a tit-for-tat blow against Trump and his tariffs, China has moved to impose a 34% tax on all US goods.\\n\\nInvestment firm Wedbush has recently criticized these tariffs, citing them as a potential “economic Armageddon” for the U.S. tech sector. Analysts headed by Dan Ives believe that the impact of these tariffs could be even worse than previous major market crashes, such as the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. This could wipe out a decade of technological progress in the US.\\n\\nREAD ALSO: and .\\n\\n“The concept of taking the U.S. back to the 1980′s ‘manufacturing days’ with these tariffs is a bad science experiment that in the process will cause an economic Armageddon in our view and crush the tech trade, AI Revolution theme and overall industry in the process.”\\n\\nAnother investment firm, Bernstein, notes how China imports $10 billion worth of chips from the United States annually. $8 billion of these are Central Processing Units (CPUs) from Intel, commonly used in laptops and servers. Since China is its largest market in 2024, it will be impacted by the tariffs. Other companies being hit by the tariffs include Micron, considering some of its chips sold in China are imported from the US. This is despite the country having production facilities in China and other countries.\\n\\nAll in all, the firm is persistent that continued tariffs would imply lower growth, lower revenues, and lower profits for companies.\\n\\n“The higher than expected tariff rates … were not factored into many investors’ or companies’ calculations. The question is will there be enough time for them to actually get those numbers in in time? Because we don’t know what the retaliation measures are going to be from some of the European partners … or even from other countries, in that sort of scenario exact numbers might be lacking in some cases”.\\n\\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ().\\n\\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\\n\\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\\n\\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. On Monday, April 8, Wedbush reiterated the stock as “Outperform” and lowered its price target to $250 per share from $325.\\n\\n“At the current situation we do not expect most tech companies to give any guidance on the 1Q conference calls over the next month including Apple given too much uncertainty.”\\n\\nEven though there is massive uncertainty when it comes to stocks such as Apple, Ives asserted that it is still one of the top names to own in the market.\\n\\n“Today will be a scary day for investors (and us) … it will create opportunities and way oversold tech stocks but we need to essentially toss out the next few quarters and start to work with some new normal financial model for 2026 for valuations as this tariff situation settles into place during negotiations,” Ives said.\\n\\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of AI stocks in focus. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The investment firm believes Apple could be exempted from the steep U.S. tariffs set to hit Chinese imports, considering the tech giant’s pledge to invest $500 billion in the country over the next four years. It further expects Apple to announce manufacturing commitments in the U.S., potentially including iPhone production.\\n\\nSpeaking of risks, Jefferies warned that Apple’s price could fall to around $150 if 54% tariff is imposed on the company. In the last five days, AAPL stock has tumbled over 20% as investor anxiety mounts over Trump’s tariffs potentially increasing iPhone prices. As of writing, the stock is trading at $172.42.\\n\\nJefferies Slashes Apple’s Earnings Outlook and Price Target\\n\\nDespite the rating upgrade, Jefferies’ five-star-rated analyst Edison Lee reduced his price target on AAPL stock to $167.88 from $202.33. The lower price target reflects worries that a global recession could hurt iPhone sales and expected price increases for upcoming models.\\n\\nAdditionally, Jefferies has lowered its iPhone shipment estimates for the next three years by 3.6% for 2025, 7.7% for 2026, and 5.5% for 2027, citing weaker demand. In terms of iPhone prices, it predicts a $50 hike for iPhone 18 models in 2026 (excluding the base version) and a $100 increase across all iPhone 19 models in 2027.\\n\\nOverall, Lee has cut its revenue forecasts by 2% to 4% and expects Apple’s earnings per share (EPS) to fall below market expectations by 2.5% to 8.5% over the same period.\\n\\nJefferies Flags AI Headwinds in Smartphones\\n\\nAnother major reason for the lowered estimates is concern over AI adoption on smartphones, including the iPhone. Lee pointed out two key challenges. First, the hardware just isn’t there yet. Without quicker memory and better tech design, iPhones can’t run large or powerful AI features. Second, the AI tools struggle to learn how people use their phones because they can’t access enough app info.\\n\\nThat said, Jefferies is optimistic. They believe the right hardware for bigger, smarter AI models will arrive by 2027 and Apple will likely be the first to use it in the iPhone 19.\\n\\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy?\\n\\nOn TipRanks, AAPL stock has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 33 Wall Street analysts.

As of 8:05 a.m. ET, here’s how major indexes look:\\n\\nDow Jones: -1.90%\\n\\nS&P Futures: -1.86%\\n\\nNasdaq: -1.56%\\n\\nWhat’s causing another day of pain in markets? Let’s dive into the major storylines below.\\n\\nChina Retaliates Against U.S. Tariffs\\n\\nAfter U.S. tariffs of 104% went into effect against China at midnight last night, the Chinese government responded by raising its rate on U.S. imports from 34% to 84%. The U.S. exports $143.5 billion worth of goods to China, whereas it imports $438.9 billion in goods.\\n\\nThat’s an overall small piece of America’s $28 trillion economy. However, China retaliating continues stoking fears that we’ll see a protracted trade war that could destabilize the global economy and leave the United States in a recession.\\n\\n10-Year Treasuries Surging\\n\\nAnother bad piece of economic news this morning is that the yield on 10-Year Treasuries is surging. One of the common thoughts on Wall Street has been that the Trump Administration is prioritizing the yields of Treasuries over the stock market. Lower treasury rates would help close the deficit by lowering interest costs and would also provide relief to parts of the economy that have been battered by higher rates – like housing.\\n\\nHowever, after rates initially plummeted following the announcement of Trump’s tariffs last Wednesday, they’re now surging. Across the past day the yield on the 10-Year Treasury has jumped an incredible .20%, and now stands at 4.46%.\\n\\nOverall, 10-Year Treasury rates have now jumped more than 50 basis points from where they traded on Monday morning. While the market has been selling off mostly on the potential for tariffs to cause a recession, rising rates are a new threat to the valuation of stocks.\\n\\nStocks to Watch on Wednesday Morning\\n\\nWith indexes down, there will be pain across most sectors today. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is down another 2% premarket after dropping 22% in the past five days. Nike (NYSE: NKE) is another stock that’s been hit hard by tariffs and is down 2% premarket.\\n\\nSome stocks that have been battered recently are holding up better than indexes. For example, NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) is actually up slightly in premarket trading even though indexes are sharply down.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.93643164634705,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:37:14 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://247wallst.com\",\n                \"title\": \"24/7 Wall St.\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -79.96821582317352,\n            \"second_model_score\": -60,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Global markets are in distress following a sharp S&P 500 decline.

Meanwhile, Apple faces added vulnerability as its manufacturing operations in India, Vietnam, and Thailand are also subject to new U.S. tariffs.\\n\\nOver the past five trading sessions, AAPL stock has plunged 22% as investors grow increasingly concerned that Trump’s tariffs will drive iPhone prices higher.

Moreover, many supply chain experts believe full-scale U.S. iPhone production is simply unrealistic. Overall, Martin said Trump’s tariffs could drive Apple’s production costs up by roughly 50%.\\n\\nMartin isn’t alone. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives echoed the concern, estimating a U.S.-made iPhone could cost as much as $3,500. Earlier this week, Ives slashed his price target on AAPL stock from $352 to $250, citing the company’s high exposure to tariff risks.\\n\\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy?\\n\\nOn TipRanks, AAPL stock has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 33 Wall Street analysts.

With President Donald Trump imposing a staggering 104% tariff on Chinese imports and China responding with an 84% levy on US goods, industries reliant on cross-border supply chains and exports are reeling. This article dives into the American companies hit hardest by the trade war, exploring the real-world impacts on their operations, stock prices, and long-term prospects.\\n\\nApple ($AAPL): A Tech Titan Under Siege\\n\\nApple, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, is caught in the crosshairs of the trade war. With over 90% of its manufacturing based in China, the $AAPL stock plummeted 8.8% on a single day in early April, erasing over $300 billion in market capitalization. Analysts estimate that the 104% tariffs could saddle Apple with nearly $40 billion in additional costs annually, potentially slashing operating profits by a third if the company absorbs them. The iPhone, a flagship product, faces price hikes that could dampen consumer demand, while China’s retaliatory tariffs threaten Apple’s significant market share in the world’s largest smartphone market. The stakes are high for $AAPL as it navigates this tariff-induced storm.\\n\\nBoeing ($BA): Flying Into Turbulence\\n\\nBoeing, a cornerstone of American aerospace, is another casualty of the trade war’s escalation. China’s 84% tariffs on US goods directly target aircraft, making $BA’s planes far more expensive than competitors like Airbus and China’s COMAC. Already strained by past safety scandals and delivery delays, Boeing now faces a potential freeze on its 45-81 plane deliveries scheduled for 2025-2027 to China’s top airlines. The company’s reliance on China—one of its largest export markets—means these tariffs could slash revenues and cede market share to rivals. $BA’s stock has taken a hit, reflecting investor fears of a prolonged trade standoff.\\n\\nCaterpillar ($CAT): Digging a Deeper Hole\\n\\nCaterpillar, a titan in farm and construction equipment, is feeling the pinch from both sides of the tariff war. The $CAT stock is under pressure as China’s 84% tariffs compound an earlier 10% levy, targeting a sector already battered by slumping agricultural exports. China, a key market for $CAT’s machinery, buys billions in US equipment annually, but these tariffs threaten to choke demand. On the import side, higher costs for steel and components from China—vital to $CAT’s supply chain—could erode profit margins further. Analysts warn that prolonged trade tensions could force Caterpillar to rethink its global manufacturing footprint, a costly and uncertain pivot.\\n\\nDeere & Co. ($DE): Harvesting Losses\\n\\nThe agricultural sector, a long-standing victim of trade wars, sees Deere & Co. at the forefront of the fallout. $DE, a leading maker of tractors and farm equipment, is hit hard by China’s tariffs on US soybeans, pork, and other agricultural goods—products that drive demand for its machinery. With China historically snapping up over half of US soybean exports (valued at $15 billion), the 84% tariffs have redirected buyers to Brazil, leaving American farmers—and by extension, $DE—high and dry. The company has already cut production by 20% in response to earlier trade disruptions, and the latest tariffs could deepen those cuts, dragging $DE’s stock and outlook into the red.\\n\\nBroader Implications for USA-Listed Firms\\n\\nBeyond these giants, the ripple effects are stark. Tech firms like Intel ($INTC) and NVIDIA ($NVDA), reliant on China for semiconductor sales, face export hurdles, while retailers like Walmart ($WMT) and Nike ($NKE) grapple with rising costs for imported goods. The S&P 500 has suffered its worst losses since the 1950s, with trillions wiped off market values since Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2. American consumers, meanwhile, brace for higher prices on everything from smartphones to tractors, as companies weigh passing on costs or eating into profits.\\n\\nA Human Perspective on a Corporate Crisis\\n\\nBehind the stock tickers and balance sheets are real stakes: jobs, livelihoods, and economic stability. Farmers in the Midwest, already stung by lost export markets, see $DE’s woes as a reflection of their own. Factory workers at $CAT plants worry about layoffs if orders dry up. Even $AAPL’s retail staff feel the uncertainty as iPhone sales forecasts dim. This trade war isn’t just a numbers game—it’s a human story of adaptation and resilience in the face of policy upheaval.\\n\\nLooking Ahead: Can These Companies Recover?\\n\\nThe path forward is murky. Some firms, like $AAPL, might accelerate moves to diversify manufacturing—India and Vietnam are on the radar, though Trump’s tariffs on those nations (26% and 46%, respectively) complicate the shift. $BA could lean harder into domestic or European markets, but losing China’s growth potential stings. $CAT and $DE, tied to agriculture and construction cycles, may face years of adjustment if trade tensions persist. Investors, meanwhile, are left guessing: will Trump’s tariffs force a renegotiation, or are we in for a prolonged economic slugfest?\\n\\nThe US-China trade war, now at its fiercest, has turned USA-listed companies into unwilling frontline soldiers. For $AAPL, $BA, $CAT, $DE, and others, the battle is about survival—navigating tariffs, protecting profits, and preserving their place in a fracturing global economy. As the dust settles, one thing is clear: the casualties of this war extend far beyond the headlines.\\n\\nShayne Heffernan\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -98.92676174640656,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:11:59 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.livetradingnews.com\",\n                \"title\": \"livetradingnews.com\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"South Asia\",\n                \"Latin America & Caribbean\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -69.46338087320328,\n            \"second_model_score\": -40,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Consumer Staples\",\n                \"Industrials\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"The US-China trade war, intensifying as of April 9, 2025, heavily impacts USA-listed companies.

This location may provide support near a trendline that connects a range of comparable trading activity on the chart between September 2021 and March 2023.\\n\\nA more significant drop brings lower support at the $138 level into play. Investors could seek long-term buying opportunities in this region near two key troughs on the chart that preceded the notable January 2023 swing low.\\n\\nKey Overhead Area Worth Monitoring\\n\\nDuring recovery efforts, it’s worth monitoring the $197 area. Apple shares would likely face overhead selling pressure in this location near twin peaks that developed on the chart in July and December 2023.\\n\\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

with this daily recap compiled by The Fly:\\n\\nStay Ahead of the Market:\\n\\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with\\n\\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using\\n\\nADDITIONAL TARIFFS: In a post to Truth Social, President Donald stated, “Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set. Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th. Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\\n\\nEXPORTER TAX CREDIT: Trump administration officials are debating the merits of creating a new exporter tax credit, which would be geared toward boosting U.S. manufacturers and issued at the end of the year to offset the effects of retaliatory tariffs as American companies seek to sell their goods in foreign markets, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg’s Nancy Cook and Saleha Mohsin.\\n\\nCOUNTER-TARIFFS: The European Commission proposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a range of U.S. goods on Monday in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum, a document seen by Reuters showed. The tariffs on some goods will come into effect May 16 and others on December 1, according to the document, which also showed that bourbon was removed from the original list the Commission was weighing in March.\\n\\nGREAT CALL WITH SOUTH KOREA: President Trump said via , “I just had a great call with the Acting President of South Korea. We talked about their tremendous and unsustainable Surplus, Tariffs, Shipbuilding, large scale purchase of U.S. LNG, their joint venture in an Alaska Pipeline, and payment for the big time Military Protection we provide to South Korea. They began these Military payments during my first term, Billions of Dollars, but Sleepy Joe Biden, for reasons unknown, terminated the deal. That was a shocker to all! In any event, we have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries. Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good. We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States. Like with South Korea, we are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. ‘ONE STOP SHOPPING’ is a beautiful and efficient process!!! China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”\\n\\nNEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN: Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent stated in a , “Following a very constructive phone discussion with the Government of Japan, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has tasked me and @USTradeRep to open negotiations to implement the President’s vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade with @JPN_PMO Shigeru Ishiba and his Cabinet.”\\n\\nTARIFF ENDGAME: In a report out last night, Politico’s Megan Messerly and Sam Sutton that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had traveled to Florida on Sunday to steer President Trump to focus his messaging on negotiating favorable trade deals or risk the stock market falling further. Citing two people familiar with discussions, Bessent suggested that stocks will remain under pressure unless there is greater emphasis on the endgame with tariffs, which is winning deals with other countries, the report states. The rollout of April 2nd was to create “maximum leverage” over foreign governments, Politico states.\\n\\nCOAL INDUSTRY: President Donald Trump will sign executive orders on Tuesday aimed at boosting the country’s coal industry, Reuters’ Jarrett Renshaw and Timothy Gardner . Two sources familiar with the matter say Trump is scheduled to sign energy-related orders at the White House at 3 p.m. He plans to sign several executive orders directing the Interior and Energy Departments to take actions to support the industry, including saving coal plants at risk of retirement, according to a source briefed on the details of the event. Publicly traded companies in the space include Alliance Resource Partners ARLP), Arch Resources , Consol Energy and Peabody Energy BTU).\\n\\nMORE FROM INDIA: Apple AAPL) plans to send more iPhones to the U.S. from India to offset the high cost of China tariffs, people familiar with the matter said, The Wall Street Journal’s Yang Jie and Rolfe Winkler . The adjustments are a short-term stopgap while Apple attempts to win an exemption from President Trump’s tariffs — which Chief Executive Tim Cook obtained during the first Trump administration. The company sees the situation as too uncertain to upend long-term investments in its supply chain, the people said. Trump’s tariff package raises levies on Chinese goods to at least 54% while imposing a 26% rate on Indian goods, the authors note.\\n\\nAMERICAN WHISKEY: Industries across the U.S. are bracing for higher prices for import ahead of tariffs as well as new restrictions on their exports as countries prepare to retaliate, Alan Rappeport of The New York Times . While Trump aims to protect domestic sectors such as steel and aluminum, his tariff strategy is putting the economic squeeze on other American industries. America’s whiskey industry has become a favorite target for retaliation, and the blowback is painful for dstillers and the companies that supply them. Publicly traded stocks include AB InBev BUD), Constellation Brands STZ), Brown Forman BF.A), and Diageo DEO).\\n\\nHOLDING CARS: Volkswagen’s VWAGY) Audi is holding its cars which arrived after April 2, when U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on autos imports, in U.S. ports, Reuters . The Volkswagen brand has around 37,000 vehicles, sufficient for approximately two months of sales, in its U.S. inventory, a spokesperson says.\\n\\nTARIFF PLAN SHOULD CHANGE: Life Time Group LTH) CEO Bahram Akradi said President Trump’s tariff campaign could improve the country’s trade position, but the current number of levies would be economically disastrous if not amended, Dean Seal of The Wall Street Journal . Akradi said he is hopeful the U.S. can use the new tariffs to negotiate rapid deals across the world to unwind the total amount of levies in global trade. “The strategy of saying ‘we want to be treated correctly, fairly, and with respect’ makes sense,” Akradi said, according to the Journal. “The word tariff is not a beautiful word. I disagree with that-we are in a global economy.”\\n\\nEXPAND IMMIGRANT DETENTION: Trump administration is seeking to spend tens of billions of dollars for new detention facilities to allow the government to expedite the contracting process and rapidly expand detention, The New York Times’ Allison McCann, Alexandra Berzon and Hamed Aleaziz. Public company stocks that could react to the news include Group and CoreCivic CXW).\\n\\nLAWSUIT: Paramount ,PARAA) and President Trump are set to begin mediation in his $20B lawsuit against CBS News, with both sides choosing a mediator for the case in recent days, Lauren Hirsch and Benjamin Mullin of The New York Times , citing people with knowledge of the decision.

During a recent press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said former President Donald Trump believes the United States has the resources and labor needed to produce smartphones domestically. Earlier in the day, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that product-specific or company-specific tariff exemptions would not be granted under the current trade plan.\\n\\nBack in 2018, Apple received an exemption during an earlier U.S.-China trade dispute, which helped it avoid tariffs on iPhones largely assembled in China. But this time, analysts suggest the outlook may be more severe.\\n\\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities warned last week that the uncertainty surrounding tariffs could inflate iPhone prices dramatically up to $3,500 although that estimate has been met with skepticism. He noted that domestic manufacturing would severely impact Apple's margins and pricing models.\\n\\nApple's efforts to broaden its manufacturing footprint including in India, Vietnam, and Brazil have not insulated the company from tariff exposure, as these countries are also targeted by new trade measures.\\n\\nThe Times of India reported Apple shipped five aircraft full of iPhones from India to the U.S. to preempt a 10% tariff. The Wall Street Journal added that Apple is considering shifting more production to India in response.\\n\\nNeedham analysts have projected that Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings could fall by at least 28% if the trade dispute continues and no exemption is granted. Meanwhile, China has responded to new U.S. tariffs with its own 34% duties on certain American imports and warned of further retaliation. Trump, for his part, has threatened a 50% tariff on Chinese goods if the current levies are not rolled back.\\n\\nThis article first appeared on .\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.99939203262329,\n            \"published_date\": \"Thu, 10 Apr 2025 09:40:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": \"GuruFocus.com\",\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"South Asia\",\n                \"Latin America & Caribbean\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -82.49969601631165,\n            \"second_model_score\": -64.99999999999999,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Industrials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Apple's stock is declining, losing its top market value position, amid concerns about potential tariffs.

Year to date, Apple shares are down 25% and are 23.5% since its last earnings release, lagging the S&P 500, which has dropped 13.7% and 16.6% during the same time frame.Though he admitted the possibility of near-term loss, Mohan said Apple's value reduction has always produced good returns. Apple's share price fell between 5% and 11% in the next three months during comparable events between April and August 2022. Those times, meanwhile, also showed upside potential from 11% to 26%.Apple's latest stock price drop occurs against more general global uncertainty, especially about tariff concerns and artificial intelligence capabilities like a customized Siri. Mohan warned that the possibility of relations with China to increase might harm profit projections.Mohan said, nonetheless, that Apple had several levers to control negative risk. These include : changing the schedule of new product launches, obtaining better supplier conditions, moving more iPhone manufacturing to India, raising product and service costs, and launching premium items.\\n\\nThis article first appeared on .\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 100,\n            \"published_date\": \"Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:50:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": \"GuruFocus.com\",\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"South Asia\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 72.5,\n            \"second_model_score\": 44.99999999999999,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Bank of America believes Apple's (AAPL) stock selloff presents a buying opportunity for long-term investors, citing historical trends of strong returns after its P/E ratio falls below 25.

Trump in the United States.\\n\\nLeavitts comments followed a statement by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who said the administration would not grant exemptions for individual products or companies from the presidents broad tariff policy. During the 2018 U.S.-China trade war, Apple received such an exemption for its iPhones, which are largely produced in China.\\n\\nAnalyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said the tariff uncertainty has upended Apples supply chain and could lead to iPhone prices as high as $3,500 if the company is forced to manufacture domestically. He warned of potentially severe near-term margin compression.\\n\\nDespite efforts to reduce its dependence on China, Apple continues to rely on the country for a significant share of its hardware production. Investment firm Needham recently estimated that Apples fiscal 2025 earnings could fall by at least 28% if the company does not receive relief from the latest tariff regime.\\n\\nApple and its suppliers also produce hardware in India, Vietnam and Brazil, all of which are now subject to U.S. tariffs. Apple recently shipped five airplane loads of iPhones from India to the U.S. to avoid a 10% tariff imposed on Indian goods, according to a report by The Times of India. The Wall Street Journal reported Apple is accelerating plans to expand manufacturing in India.\\n\\nMeanwhile, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated. In response to Trumps tariff expansion to all imports from China and other countries, China imposed a 34% tariff on select U.S. goods.

That move has helped make Apple one of the world’s most valuable companies and cement itself as a dominant smartphone maker.\\n\\nSince Trump’s inauguration in late January, Apple’s shares have lost around 25% of their value due to concerns about the impact of tariffs on its sprawling supply chain, which is highly dependent on China and Taiwan. About 90% of iPhones are assembled in China.\\n\\n“That’s why I think you see what’s happened to the stock, because no company is more caught up in this tariff front and center in this category five storm than Cupertino and Apple,” he said. “It’s an economic Armageddon, but especially for the tech industry.”\\n\\nThe chips that power iPhones are mainly manufactured in Taiwan, while its screen panels are supplied by South Korean companies.

Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year, and e-commerce sales surged.\\n\\nHowever, Walmart’s profitability is being impacted by rising selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, thanks to tech investments, higher wages and marketing. Also, volatile currency fluctuations are expected to further pressure sales in the upcoming fiscal year.\\n\\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\\n\\nShares of Coca-Cola have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+17.9% vs. +1.3%). The company has experienced positive business trends, as evident by its strong track record of beating expectations. In fourth-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the eighth consecutive quarter, with earnings showing year-over-year improvement.\\n\\nResults benefited from continued business momentum, aided by higher pricing across markets facing intense inflation and favorable mix. Coca-Cola's all-weather strategy -- combining marketing, innovation, and revenue growth management -- supports its vision of a total beverage company and is expected to drive revenue growth in 2025.\\n\\nCoca-Cola has provided an optimistic view for 2025. However, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.\\n\\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\\n\\nHSBC’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry over the past year (+28.5% vs. +8.3%). The company’s strong capital position, relatively high interest rates, global network and business simplification initiatives will keep supporting the company’s financials. As part of its Asia pivot strategy, it is moving away from less profitable markets and has announced the sale of businesses in Germany and South Africa.\\n\\nHSBC has exited retail operations in the U.S., Canada, France, New Zealand, Greece, Russia, Argentina and Armenia. While efforts to strengthen its market share in Asia will support financials, they will likely lead to an increase in expenses.\\n\\nFor 2025, the company expects operating expenses to increase 3%. Additionally, the company’s subdued revenue performance -- in light of weaker loan demand amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop -- is a concern.\\n\\n(You can read the full research report on HSBC here >>>)\\n\\nShares of Friedman Industries have underperformed the Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry over the past year (-24.6% vs. -1.4%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $97.38 million has seen fiscal third-quarter sales decline 18.9% year over year. The tubular segment remains weak and high inventory levels pose risks amid steel price volatility.\\n\\nRising costs and debt burdens could pressure profitability despite hedging strategies and operational efficiencies. Nevertheless, Friedman Industries' sales backlog grew 11% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025, signaling stronger demand and potential revenue recovery.\\n\\nPost-election stability has driven increased order activity, with fiscal fourth-quarter sales and margin expansion expected as hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices rebound. Debt fell 9% to $32.5 million, with $99.2 million in available credit supporting operations. Industry tailwinds include a projected increase in HRC prices and rising infrastructure and manufacturing investments.\\n\\n(You can read the full research report on Friedman Industries here >>>)\\n\\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\\n\\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Given what has been a grinding and, at times, grueling season, it would have been understandable if Rory McIlroy locked himself away somewhere quiet until the PGA Tour gets back in the signature-event business early next year.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nInstead, he’s back at work this week on the DP World Tour at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship where he can clinch his sixth Race to Dubai title with a runner-up finish. That would tie the Northern Irishman with Seve Ballesteros at second on the all-time European season-long champions list and leave him two behind Colin Montgomerie, who won eight Order of Merit titles.\\n\\n“I pride myself – I’m a European player. I would like to go down as the most successful European of all time,” McIlroy said. “Obviously, Race to Dubai wins would count to that but also major championships and, hopefully, I’ve got a few more Ryder Cups ahead of me as well. So that’s something that I would like to, I think is a goal that’s quite attainable over the next 10 years.”\\n\\nRemembering Jon. Erik van Rooyen dedicated his victory at last year’s World Wide Technology Championship to his college teammate, Jon Trasamar, who had learned just before the start of last year’s event that his melanoma cancer, which had been in remission, returned.\\n\\nTrasamar died less than a week after that victory and van Rooyen admitted that his return this week to El Cardonal at Diamante to defend his title has been “triggering.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVan Rooyen’s best friend, Jon Trasamar, died last year but left a lasting legacy with those who knew him.\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\n“For sure, being back here triggered it. I think about him often, but obviously coming up on Monday, it's a year since he passed next week, so obviously being here, coming up on Monday, thinking about him a lot, thinking about Allie a lot, his wife,” said van Rooyen, who is marking his golf balls this week with the letters “JT” to honor Trasamar. “When I played the pro-am yesterday, I played the back nine and coming down 18 I got a bit emotional coming down there just with everything that transpired last year. Yeah, he's absolutely on my mind.”\\n\\nDespite those memories and the emotions of returning to Diamante, van Rooyen opened with a 4-under 68 Thursday and was tied for fourth.\\n\\nMade Cut-Did Not Finish (MDF)\\n\\nPolitics. McIlroy stumbled, however inadvertently, into a political lion’s den when he was asked this week if Tuesday’s presidential election outcome could impact the ongoing negotiations between the Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Given today’s news with what has happened in America, I think that clears the way a little bit. So, we’ll see,” he offered before adding the obvious a few moments later, “But I think as the President of the United States again, he’s probably got bigger things to focus on than golf.”\\n\\nMcIlroy’s political faux pas aside, the idea that Donald Trump’s second term as president could fast-track a potential Department of Justice investigation ignores the facts. The current investigation is focused on the Tour, not LIV Golf or the PIF, and has been going on for a few years.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRory McIlroy said Wednesday that Donald Trump’s return to the White House could mark a “huge moment” in golf’s ongoing civil war.\\n\\n,\\n\\n,\\n\\nA potential deal between the Tour and PIF could lead to an expanded investigation, likely by another regulatory agency, but as we’ve learned after nearly a year and a half of wait-and-see, the challenges of a potential deal go well beyond a DOJ investigation.\\n\\nSustainability. No, not the kind of sustainability that keeps greenkeepers up at night. This type of sustainability keeps chief executives, like the USGA’s Mike Whan, awake.\\n\\nIn a sprawling interview with GolfDigest.com, Whan covered a wide-range of topics, but perhaps the most telling – and apropos, given the state of the professional game – came when he was asked what “other important questions” keep him up at night.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Obviously, there’s a significant arms race with money,” Whan said. “When I took this job, our women's U.S. Open purse was $5.5 million and now it's $12 million. Our men’s purse was $12 million and now it's $21.5 million.”\\n\\nWhan went on to explain that those increases have been fueled by media rights deals which could possibly impact the USGA’s ability to keep pace with the outside economic forces that have led to recent increases.\\n\\n“If those [rights deals and purses] are going in different directions, we've got tough choices ahead. If that doesn't keep you awake as a CEO, you're not spending time on the right stuff,” he said.\\n\\nMissed Cut\\n\\nBlow back. The Tour likely anticipated criticism from players when it unveiled its proposed plan to reduce the number of fully exempt members by about 20 percent beginning in 2026, but the level of push back has been surprising.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“It’s terrible, it really is,” Padriag Harrington said Wednesday on \\\"Golf Today\\\" of the proposed plan. “I can’t think of how bad it is. At the end of the day, the people who are on the inside are voting to keeping the thing tighter and more closed. Sure, why don’t we have 12 people involved if I’m included and everyone else can go home.\\n\\n“The Tour was running just fine. I know there is certain pressure on time to get fields finished when they go to 156 during certain times of year, but players will deal with that. This is one way to solve one of the biggest issues in golf, pace of play, but you want to give everyone the opportunity.”\\n\\nThe plan would reduce nearly every field on Tour and drop the number of fully exempt members from 125 off the previous season’s points list to 100, along with a reduction in the number of memberships awarded to the Korn Ferry Tour to the top 20 (down from the top 30).\\n\\n“I thought [the proposed plan] was asinine like most of our recent changes,” Lucas Glover said. “Limiting players doesn’t help competition. We’re the only sport that decreased the number of teams or players, every other sport has expanded their playoffs or expanded their fields. We are doing the opposite. The Tour’s job description is to do what’s right for the membership, not a few members.”\\n\\nThe policy board is scheduled to vote on the plan in two weeks and last week’s announcement felt like a trial balloon to gauge player reaction, which if Harrington and Glover are the standard, has not been the best. The plan will likely be approved but it won’t be overwhelmingly popular.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.49231743812561,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 10:19:52 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://sports.yahoo.com\",\n                \"title\": \"Yahoo Sports\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"North America\",\n                \"Middle East & North Africa\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -79.7461587190628,\n            \"second_model_score\": -60,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Communication Services\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"This week's golf news covers several topics.

The asset class can offer alternative sources of risk-adjusted returns, pay more than traditional fixed income, and provide potential for spread compression as an additional layer of return. Taking a global and dynamic investment approach allows investors to unlock the complexity and illiquidity premiums on offer within this asset class.\\n\\nAllocating to Securitised Credit\\n\\nSecuritised Credit has a low correlation to traditional fixed income. Over a 14-year period to December 2024, the HSBC Global Investment Grade Securitised Credit Composite had a 0.46 correlation to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Corporate Index. This makes sense, given its distinctive return, volatility, and duration profile. For a multi-asset allocator, this makes a compelling diversification case.\\n\\nSecuritised Credit has had higher returns than fixed income corporates and government bonds over the longer term. It has also had a lower volatility and thus higher Sharpe ratios over the past 14 years.\\n\\nOn top of having low correlations to traditional fixed income, Securitised Credit also benefits from a complexity premium, as it is an over-the-counter (OTC) hand traded market, which requires deep credit research resources to unlock value. There is also an illiquidity premium, as the asset class is slightly less liquid than corporate bonds across the rating stack. Although, this is less pronounced for higher rated securities than the lower rated ones.\\n\\nAs a result of this, even during periods where interest rates are low and coupons are lower, spreads will likely remain above that of traditional fixed income, making an allocation to high quality Securitised Credit an interesting option for investors in 2025.\\n\\nMoving on from the 60/40 portfolio\\n\\nTraditional fixed income has historically been viewed as a diversifier to equities and we are all well versed with the “60–40” portfolio.\\n\\nHowever, the “lower-for-longer” interest rate environment, the “Great Fixed Income Reset” and now a potential “higher-for-longer” scenario, have forced investors to reconsider their asset allocations.\\n\\nNot only does Securities Credit have a low correlation to traditional fixed income, it also has a lower correlation to US equities than corporate bonds, making it a key consideration for multi-asset investors. Comparing traditional High Yield corporate bonds to the S&P 500, the correlation is as high as 0.8. However, when comparing Securitised Credit against the S&P 500, we see correlations as low as 0.29 across major sectors within this asset class.\\n\\nThe demand is there\\n\\nAnother key consideration for institutional investors is the returns, regulatory and operational benefits that a Securitised Credit allocation can provide. For insurance companies, subject to the underlying applied regulatory environment, it offers higher returns than traditional fixed income across all credit ratings with similar credit charges. For pension funds, and particularly LDI strategies, Securitised Credit can provide balance to their collateral waterfall, and it can provide liquidity when it is so desperately needed. Other pension schemes have previously allocated to illiquid private debt, with the trend now being a reversal into more liquid Securitised Credit.\\n\\nOther than pension and insurance firms, multi-asset allocators like the low correlation and diversification benefits whilst Private Banks and Family Offices like the income generation. Furthermore, Corporate Treasurers, looking for an alternative to cash, have been allocating to Securitised Credit within their strategic cash bucket.\\n\\nSecuritised Credit serves a variety of purposes across varying investor profiles. Thus, it should come as no surprise that this clientele will most likely continue to allocate to the sector.\\n\\n2025’s path for Securitised Credit\\n\\nSecuritised Credit has and is expected to continue to benefit from the current macroeconomic environment. High interest rates have meant that the asset class is generating high levels of income.\\n\\nThe future direction for interest rates is likely to be downwards. Although we don’t know the size and speed of cuts, the destination is unlikely to be zero. Interest rates are more likely to move to a more neutral rate. As Securitised Credit generated positive returns when interest rates were zero, it is likely the asset class will continue to make money as interest rates fall.\\n\\nInterest rate cuts will be beneficial for the asset class, as this will make servicing the underlying debt more manageable (hence reducing loan defaults and delinquencies) whilst income generation on the floating rate bonds remains significant. This would also lead to potential spread tightening, allowing investors to benefit from a capital gain.\\n\\nFor a strategic asset allocator, the unique return profile, low correlations to traditional asset classes and superior Sharpe ratios make it an important consideration.\\n\\nAndrew Jackson is Head of Portfolio Management, Securitised Credit and Paul Mitchell is Senior Investment Specialist Global, Securitised & Sterling Fixed Income\\n\\nSource: HSBC Asset Management as at 31/01/25.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 99.99998807907104,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 10:17:29 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://funds-europe.com\",\n                \"title\": \"Funds Europe\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 79.99999403953552,\n            \"second_model_score\": 60,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Securitized credit offers diversification, yield enhancement, and exposure to high-quality credit, with a low correlation to traditional fixed income and equities, making it attractive for multi-asset allocators.

Kong alone,” judges said. “But it adds to that strong client growth and a better than reasonable performance.”\\n\\nJudges were also impressed by the firm’s strong digital transformation.\\n\\nWith over 50% of MPF clients now engaging through digital tools, Manulife’s partnership with WealthTech firms and launch of an AI-powered MPF robo-advisor has materially improved user engagement and

Despite being in the top 4% of UK earners, only one in 10 people earning £100,000 or more would describe themselves as ‘wealthy’, while only 1% of the UK population identify as such. High earners also place the threshold for wealth much higher, citing £724,000 as the income it takes to be considered wealthy.\\n\\nDespite being in the top 4%, high earners position themselves in the top 52% relative to the rest of the UK population, just above average[2]. This highlights a significant disconnect between perceived and actual financial position and hinting to how many high earners self-identify as the ‘squeezed middle’. This is despite HSBC UK Premier customers having five times more savings and three times more money coming in and out compared to most HSBC UK customers.\\n\\nPerceptions of wealth don’t just differ across income level. The report reveals that there are also distinct regional differences both in wealth and the way it is perceived. Londoners surveyed said that it takes more than £289,000 to be wealthy on average. Meanwhile, those in the Northeast say it’s an average of £80,000.\\n\\nHigher earners aiming high in terms of goals\\n\\nHSBC UK’s analysis reveals that high earners often have ambitious financial goals, but just under half (44%) of those with financial goals feel they are on track to achieve them. This drops significantly to only one in five (21%) of the general population. Despite not feeling on track to meet their goals, most people are optimistic about their financial futures, with 95% of high earners and 85% of the general population believing that their financial goals are achievable.\\n\\nWhen it comes to financial ambitions among high earners, almost half (48%) are aiming for a comfortable retirement, home ownership (30%), or want to make significant home improvements (20%). But the need to prioritise more immediate costs (27%), insufficient savings (11%), and unpredictable income (14%) remain challenging, even for this more affluent group.\\n\\nCredit plays an important part in helping higher earners manage their day-to-day finances. HSBC UK customer data shows that Premier customers are nearly twice as likely than most HSBC customers to also hold a HSBC UK credit card, although maximizing points and benefits will be a key driver of this trend. Meanwhile, one in 10 HSBC Premier-qualified customers are using their overdrafts regularly, compared to one in six general population customers.\\n\\nVicky Reynal, Financial Psychotherapist, said: “HSBC UK’s findings reveal a paradox: despite having high earnings and ambitious financial goals, many mass affluent individuals still don’t feel wealthy. This disconnect underscores the psychology behind people’s perceptions of wealth.\\n\\n“Anxieties about rising costs, inadequate savings, and the pressure of social comparison create a sense of scarcity, even when objective wealth exists. By redefining wealth beyond the bank balance, focusing on our achievements, reducing unhelpful comparisons, and prioritising financial actions within our control, people can move confidently toward the future they aspire to.”\\n\\nInvestments key indicator of wealth for more than half of Brits\\n\\nHSBC UK also explores diverse attitudes towards signifiers of wealth. While over half (51%) of the general population identifies owning a private jet or a yacht (48%) as the main signifier of wealth, high earners are more likely to consider non-material factors – such as retiring early (48%), frequently travelling abroad (45%) or having investments (54%) – as more relevant symbols.\\n\\nInvestments have emerged as critical markers of wealth across the board, with 49% of the general population seeing this as a key signifier of wealth. While the majority (55%) of those earning over £100K have investments, this figure drops dramatically to just 18% of the general population.\\n\\nAlmost half (49%) of Gen Z (18–24-year-olds) consider wealth in non-material terms, compared to one third (35%) of those aged 35-44. When it comes to high earning 18–24-year-olds, one third believe that having a strong work-life balance is a strong signifier of wealth, and 41% are aspiring to this in the next two years.\\n\\nAmong the nationally representative sample, this generation is also likely to be proactive and open about their finances, with nearly half of 18–24-year-olds saying they like talking about money compared to just 3% of over 55s. This proactivity is reflected in their investment behaviour, with nearly half (43%) of high earners in this group already having an investment portfolio, and less than one in five (17%) of those in the nationally representative sample are aspiring to do so.\\n\\nXian Chan, Head of Premier Wealth, HSBC UK said: “Wealth is a deeply personal concept, that is dependent not only on people’s objective financial position but also on how they feel about money.\\n\\n“People often evaluate their sense of wealth in relation to how financially secure they feel, and how close they are to being able to achieve their financial goals. But the key for everyone is in early preparation. Investments remain the most significant signifier of wealth, and adding to those gradually over the long-term is a crucial step for building towards prosperity. Starting to save even a small amount regularly, and as early as possible, while developing regular habits, is one of the most important things that we can do to plan successfully for our financial futures.\\n\\n“At HSBC UK, we’re committed to working with our customers to help them define wealth for themselves, take control of their futures, and start building towards their aspirations – whether they’re already on their wealth journey, or just starting out.”\\n\\nHSBC UK’s latest report reveals a shift to a more holistic view of wealth among high earners. The bank’s new, enhanced Premier offer features tailored benefits across health, wealth, international and travel. From comprehensive healthcare cover to lounge access and personalised wealth management, the new Premier offer caters to high earners looking to build and grow their wealth, whatever their ambitions may be.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -55.36190999878777,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 09:10:11 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://londonlovesbusiness.com\",\n                \"title\": \"London Business News\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"Europe & Central Asia\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -26.90317722161611,\n            \"second_model_score\": 3.3333333333333335,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Materials\",\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"An HSBC UK report reveals a perception gap regarding wealth in the UK.

If confirmed, that would mark the industry's longest downturn in over two decades.\\n\\nBernstein analyst Luca Solca cited the fallout from Trump's April 2 announcement of import taxes on major US trading partners as reasons for the downgrade.\\n\\n\\\"Uncertainty, and the likely continuing rout in stock markets, are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: a global recession,\\\" he wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nTrump's tariffs were more sweeping than many market players feared, and have prompted retaliation from China, igniting a trade war that has left stock markets reeling.\\n\\nShares in sector leader LVMH are now down 2% since the start of the year, while Gucci owner Kering is down 31%. Hermes and Cartier owner Richemont, seen as better placed than many to weather a downturn thanks to their wealthier clientele, are down 8% and 6% respectively.\\n\\n\\\"The tariff turmoil has increased worries,\\\" said Mario Ortelli, managing partner at luxury advisory firm Ortelli & Co.\\n\\n\\\"This is not helping the sentiment of the luxury consumer.\\\"\\n\\nAll eyes will be on LVMH when it kicks off first-quarter financial reports on April 15.\\n\\nEuropean fashion and jewellery houses like LVMH's Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Richemont label Cartier had been counting on sales growth from wealthy Americans to help offset weak demand in China.\\n\\n\\\"Everything appeared so perfectly aligned,\\\" at the start of 2025, said HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg, as stock markets, the dollar, cryptocurrencies, and US consumer confidence all rose.\\n\\nBut signs of weakness emerged even before Trump's tariff bombshell. Citi data released Tuesday showed US credit card spending on luxury brands fell 5% in March and February, year-on-year, after growing the previous two months.\\n\\nVontobel analysts warned at the start of April about growing \\\"luxury fatigue\\\" and deteriorating US consumer sentiment.\\n\\nThen came the market tumult unleashed by Trump's tariffs, potentially a key influence on US spending given so much of the country's wealth is linked to equities.\\n\\nTricky pricing\\n\\nGroups like LVMH, Kering and Richemont are expected to draw on their brands' pricing power to shield profits from tariffs, but investors are worried that shoppers who can afford US$10,000 leather handbags and gold bracelets could tighten their purse strings against a darkening economic backdrop.\\n\\nIn such conditions, pricing — already a delicate balancing act after record hikes in the pandemic — will be key as shoppers become \\\"more mindful, scrutinising their spend,\\\" said Ortelli.\\n\\nUS import tariffs of 20% on goods from the European Union and 31% from Switzerland are expected to prompt European luxury brands to raise US prices by around 6% on average to protect profits, according to estimates from UBS.\\n\\nLabels including Gucci, Chanel and Cartier already raised prices on some products in March by between 5% and 6%, according to Citi, which sees further high single-digit percentage increases in the coming weeks.\\n\\nIf companies don't hike prices, Barclays forecasts a negative impact on earnings before interest and tax of 1.5% at LVMH's key fashion and leather goods division, and 2.4% at Prada and Hermes. Kering could take a 8.7% hit, due to lower pricing power at Gucci as it undergoes a revamp, while Swiss-based watchmaker Richemont could see a 7.1% decline, it estimated.\\n\\nThe US is the Swiss watch industry's largest market, worth over twice as much in terms of exports as China last year, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.\\n\\nEurope's luxury sector was largely spared tariffs during Trump's first term from 2017 to 2021, despite increased trade tensions.\\n\\nThis time, luxury executives are hoping that LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, will be able to leverage his links with the US president to negotiate exemptions for the sector.\\n\\nArnault, who like Trump launched his career in New York City's real estate scene in the 1980s, in January contrasted a \\\"wind of optimism\\\" in the US with the \\\"cold shower\\\" of taxes in France. LVMH did not respond to a request for comment on Arnault's current view of the US market.\\n\\nSlower start\\n\\nSales reports for the three months to the end of March are expected to show luxury sector growth slowing to 0.5% from around 3% at the end of last year, according to HSBC estimates that were drawn up before the recent stock market dives.\\n\\nLVMH's fashion and leather goods division is forecast to report flat sales, according to Visible Alpha consensus figures.\\n\\nMoncler, which reports on April 16, is forecast to post a 1.3% rise in sales, while Hermes, on April 17, is expected to deliver an almost 10% increase.\\n\\nSales at Kering, which reports on April 23, are seen falling nearly 10%, weighed down by Gucci as the group seeks to engineer its turnaround.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -49.99995827674866,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 09:09:08 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://theedgemalaysia.com\",\n                \"title\": \"The Edge Malaysia\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"Europe & Central Asia\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -39.99997913837433,\n            \"second_model_score\": -30,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Fears of a global recession, triggered by Donald Trump's tariffs, are threatening the $400 billion luxury goods industry.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\\n\\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Exxon Mobil (XOM).\\n\\nExxon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\\n\\nOf the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy, representing 59.3% of all recommendations.\\n\\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for XOM\\n\\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Exxon here>>>The ABR suggests buying Exxon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\\n\\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \\\"Strong Sell\\\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \\\"Strong Buy\\\" recommendations.\\n\\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\\n\\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\\n\\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\\n\\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\\n\\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\\n\\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\\n\\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\\n\\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\\n\\nIs XOM Worth Investing In?\\n\\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Exxon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 3.7% over the past month to $7.13.\\n\\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\\n\\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Exxon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\\n\\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Exxon with a grain of salt.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here is a list of potential beneficiaries and losers of the new trade policy.\\n\\nWhat Happened: While the tariffs of U.S. trading partners have had a damaging effect on the stock market, they have also fueled the fear of a slowdown in the economy and a possible recession.\\n\\nAccording to John Murillo, the chief dealing officer at a global fintech solutions provider for financial institutions, B2BROKER, Trump's tariffs preemptively target metals, cars, and high-tech imports into the U.S., which seemingly spells trouble, “specifically for these sectors.”\\n\\nHowever, he goes on to add that the “devil is always hiding in the details,” and sees the protectionist measures as a silver lining for the American automotive sector, predicting increased demand due to reduced foreign competition.\\n\\n“Since tariffs are imposed on foreign cars competing with U.S. cars for consumer preferences, it will be precisely the American automotive industry that reaps the fruit of this protectionism,” Murillo told Benzinga.\\n\\nMurillo states that despite the initial negative reaction following a cut in dividends by the Ford Motor Co. F executives, “Ford and General Motors Co. GM will see higher demand on their production over time, which will offset all current inconveniences with reorientation for alternative foreign supply parts producers.”\\n\\n“We must also not forget Donald Trump‘s bet on the American oil industry,” adds Murillo, stating that he will “zealously protect American businesses, and we know that conventional energy is the subject of his special focus.”\\n\\n“He is expected to fight with big oil companies worldwide in every possible way, and this is very positive news for the U.S. oil stocks despite the current softness of oil prices,” which will especially benefit classic oil producers like Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Chevron Corp. CVX, according to Murillo.\\n\\nSee Also: Cathie Wood Points To ‘Serious Liquidity Issues’ As Overnight Borrowing Rate Spreads Widen On Spiking Treasury Yields\\n\\nWhy It Matters: Tariffs are considered protectionist policies as they are taxes that a government levies on imported goods. The primary objective of tariffs is to protect domestic industries that produce the same or similar goods.\\n\\nHowever, they could lead to an increase in the prices of goods as the cost of producing the goods domestically increases.\\n\\nMurillo also highlights the companies that will lose out because of these policies in the long run.\\n\\n“The most evident losers will be retail stocks, such as Costco Wholesale Corp. COST and Walmart Inc. WMT, which traditionally formed most of their margins by arbitraging Chinese wholesale versus U.S. domestic retail prices.”\\n\\n“PC, server, and phone equipment manufacturers like HP Inc. HPQ, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, and Apple Inc. AAPL will also feel the heat because many essential parts have been delivered from China for decades,” he adds.\\n\\nPrice Action: Notably, on Tuesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY decreased by 1.57% to $496.48, while the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ saw a decline of 1.80% to $416.06, according to Benzinga Pro data.\\n\\nFollowing Tuesday’s trading session, the Nasdaq 100 is in bear market territory, having fallen 23.10% from its prior peak of 22,222.61. The S&P 500 also saw a significant decline of 18.95% from its Feb. 19 high of 6,147.43, while the Dow Jones was down 16.48% from its 52-week high.\\n\\nWednesday’s futures market indicated further potential losses, with Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 futures all trading lower.\\n\\nRead Next:\\n\\nBear Markets Hit Harder And Last Longer During Recessions, Says Strategist\\n\\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.82432126998901,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 08:23:09 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://in.benzinga.com\",\n                \"title\": \"Benzinga\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -84.9121606349945,\n            \"second_model_score\": -70,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Materials\",\n                \"Energy\",\n                \"Consumer Staples\",\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"An analyst believes Trump's tariffs, despite market concerns, could boost the U.S. automotive industry by reducing foreign competition, benefiting Ford and General Motors.

The broader market is showing signs of stress, with the Nasdaq 100 entering bear market territory.\",\n            \"tags\": [\n                \"s\",\n                \"tariffs\",\n                \"murillo\",\n                \"oil\",\n                \"market\",\n                \"american\",\n                \"goods\",\n                \"domestic\",\n                \"automotive\",\n                \"industry\",\n                \"trading\",\n                \"cars\",\n                \"foreign\",\n                \"prices\",\n                \"corp\",\n                \"p\",\n                \"500\",\n                \"donald\",\n                \"trump‘s\",\n                \"stock\",\n                \"potential\",\n                \"losers\",\n                \"protectionist\",\n                \"demand\",\n                \"benzinga\",\n                \"ford\",\n                \"current\",\n                \"parts\",\n                \"producers\",\n                \"adds\",\n                \"protect\",\n                \"companies\",\n                \"stocks\",\n                \"policies\",\n                \"cost\"\n            ],\n            \"third_model_score\": 0,\n            \"title\": \"Ford, GM To Witness 'Higher Demand' As American Carmakers Set To 'Reap The Fruit Of Protectionism,' Says Expert: Here's A List Of Potential Gainers And Losers From Trump Tariffs - Benzinga\",\n            \"url\": \"https://in.benzinga.com/25/04/44705972/ford-motor-general-motors-to-witness-higher-demand-as-american-automotives-reap-the-fruit-of-protectionism-says-expert-heres-a-list-of-potential-gainers-and-losers\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"agreement_rate\": 1,\n            \"company_names\": [\n                \"ExxonMobil\",\n                \"Entergy\",\n                \"Best Buy\",\n                \"S&P Global\",\n                \"Goldman Sachs\",\n                \"Chevron Corporation\",\n                \"Campbell's Company (The)\"\n            ],\n            \"confidence\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"For Immediate Release\\n\\nChicago, IL – April 9, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares AFRM AFRM as the Bull of the Day and RH RH as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Chevron Corp. CVX and Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM.\\n\\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks.\\n\\nBull of the Day:\\n\\nAFRM is a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is a financial services company that offers \\\"buy now, pay later\\\" solutions, allowing customers to make purchases and pay over time.\\n\\nThe company provides flexible payment plans, including interest-free options, across various merchants.\\n\\nThe stock was flying high just a couple months ago, but the recent market sell off has brought AFRM down to 6-month lows. This sell-off looks like a great opportunity for long-term investors to get exposure to the fintech space.\\n\\nAbout the Company\\n\\nAffirm was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The stock is valued at $12 billion, and the company employs 2,000.\\n\\nThe company provides flexible payment solutions through its platform, which includes a consumer-facing app, merchant commerce tools, and point-of-sale financing. Backed by partnerships with banks, Affirm enables customers to buy now and pay over time, without hidden fees or compounding interest.\\n\\nAffirm's services power transactions for a diverse range of merchants, from small businesses to large enterprises, across sectors including travel, fashion, home goods, sporting equipment, electronics, and general retail.\\n\\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of “B” in Growth and “A” in Momentum. However, AFRM has an “F” score in Value.\\n\\nQ2 Earnings Beat\\n\\nThe company last reported earnings back in February posting an EPS beat of 215%. With that. The company beat on revenues and raised guidance.\\n\\nQ3 revenues are now seen at $755-785M, above the $773M expected. FY25 revenues were taken up to $3.13-3.19B v the $3.11B expected.\\n\\nActive Merchants were 337.2K v the 323K last quarter while Active Consumers were 21M v the 19.5M last quarter.\\n\\nAffirm’s management highlighted a record-breaking holiday season, with standout growth across key categories like third-party marketplaces (up 44%) and travel (up 42%), and a 113% year-over-year jump in Affirm Card GMV. A major driver was 70% growth in 0% APR GMV. The company is nearing profitability ahead of its target, citing strong operating leverage, resilient unit economics, and confidence in navigating high-rate environments. Leadership emphasized Affirm’s competitive edge in credit performance, merchant trust, and consumer experience.\\n\\nEstimates Headed Higher\\n\\nThe company has seen analyst estimates go higher across most time frames.\\n\\nFor the current quarter, estimates have gone from -$0.15 to -$0.07 over the last 90 days. Next quarter, the move has stayed flat over the last 90 days, with analysts seeing $0.09.\\n\\nFor the current year, estimates have jumped from $-0.55 to -$0.10 since that earnings report. And for next year, estimates have gone from $0.50 to $0.61. This is a move of 18% over the last 90 days.\\n\\nAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Affirm Holdings, Inc. Quote\\n\\nSince earnings, there have been a handful of firms reiterating their buy ratings:\\n\\nBMO Capital Markets resumed AFRM with Outperform, with a price target of $69.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs reiterated AFRM with Buy with a price target of $56.\\n\\nTD Cowen initiates AFRM with Buy and a price target of $50.\\n\\nThe Technical Take\\n\\nAFRM started the year strong, moving from $50-80 in the first six weeks. However, the stock has seen a violent correction with the recent market weakness.\\n\\nThe stock looks to have bottomed around the $30 area and is starting to bounce. There seems to be more meat on the bone here with the moving averages significant above current trading levels.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at some potential resistance:\\n\\n21-day: $46.00\\n\\n200-day: $48.25\\n\\n50-day: $57.20\\n\\nFibonacci resistance: $62\\n\\nWhile the stock might find a hard time lifting with the ongoing market weakness. Investors should keep an eye on these levels for profit taking.\\n\\nIn Summary\\n\\nAffirm is showing strong momentum as it nears profitability, backed by robust revenue growth, expanding user and merchant bases, and increasing analyst confidence.\\n\\nWith a record-setting holiday quarter, raised guidance, and improving estimates, the company is proving its ability to thrive even in a higher-rate environment.\\n\\nWhile the stock has pulled back from its early-year highs, the recent bounce and positive technical setup suggest further upside potential. For investors seeking growth and momentum in the fintech space, AFRM is a name worth watching closely.\\n\\nBear of the Day:\\n\\nRH is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that operates as a retailer and lifestyle brand in the home furnishings market. The company offers products in various categories, including furniture, lighting, textiles, bath ware, décor, outdoor and garden, baby, child, and teen furnishings.\\n\\nThe company faces headwinds from tariffs and a slumping stock market. And if that was not enough, the stock just dropped over 40% and earnings last week.\\n\\nWhile this might be a bargain in the long-run, investors should be cautious as the stock likely is in store for a rough 2025.\\n\\nAbout the Company\\n\\nRH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc., rebranded in 2017 and is headquartered in Corte Madera, California.\\n\\nFounded in 1980, the company markets its luxury home furnishings through multiple channels, including its website, hospitality spaces, sourcebooks, trade and contract programs, and a network of RH Galleries, outlet stores, guesthouses, Interior Design offices, and Waterworks showrooms.\\n\\nRH is valued at $3 billion and has a Forward PE of 15. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “F” in Growth and “D” in Value.\\n\\nQ4 Earnings\\n\\nRH reported earnings on April 2nd, seeing a17% EPS miss. The company also posted a revenue miss and guided FY25 revenue growth +10-13%.\\n\\nManagement struck a cautious tone looking forward, pointing to a riskier business environment shaped by macroeconomic pressures and ongoing tariff uncertainty. Tariffs from key sourcing countries like China, Canada, and Mexico remain a major headwind, with the potential to shift quickly. Some rates may drop from 45% to 25%, but timing and policy direction remain unclear.\\n\\nWhile RH is attempting to mitigate these pressures through supplier negotiations and by leveraging its scale, the unpredictability of tariffs continues to weigh on margins and adds complexity to near-term planning.\\n\\nThe stock dropped from the $240 level all the way to $123 the next day. It has since bounced 40 points, but investors might want to take off risk as analysts lower their earnings estimates.\\n\\nEarnings Estimates Falling\\n\\nSince reporting earnings, estimates have fallen off a cliff.\\n\\nOver the last 7 days, analysts have taken numbers down a staggering 79% for the current quarter. The drop, from $1.43 to $0.30, reflects the short-term pain.\\n\\nBut the trouble continues, with next quarter's numbers falling 10%, going from $3.95 to $3.56.\\n\\nThe current year’s estimates go from $13.26 to $11.00, or a drop of 17%.\\n\\nNext year, numbers over the last 7 days have gone from $19.89 to $15.92, a 20% reduction in the consensus.\\n\\nTechnical Take\\n\\nThe stock is trading at lows not seen since COVID. From those lows in 2020, the stock shot to $744, but has fallen to the $150 area. This 80% drop from highs looks like a bargain, but investors should watch the technical levels before feeling comfortable getting on the long side.\\n\\nThe 21- day MA is $220, while the 50-day $302 and the 200-day is $318. Those levels are likely going to come down over time so keep an eye on those long-term for an entry.\\n\\nBut for now, the stock just fell into a “Death Cross” which is when the 50-day falls below the 200-day. If there is further pressure on the market and RH, the COVID lows under $80 could be in play. So with that risk on the table, investors need to shy away.\\n\\nIn Summary\\n\\nWhile RH may eventually present a long-term value opportunity, the near-term outlook remains highly uncertain. Tariff volatility, falling earnings estimates, and technical weakness—highlighted by a recent death cross—paint a bearish picture for the stock in 2025.\\n\\nWith analysts slashing forecasts and macroeconomic headwinds mounting, investors are likely better off staying on the sidelines until clearer signs of stabilization emerge.\\n\\nAdditional content:\\n\\nWorried About Tariffs? Keep a Close Eye on These 2 Energy Stocks\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump’s recently imposed tariff has rattled the equity market. The question in everybody’s mind is whether the tariffs will be in place for an extended period. If the tariffs stick around for a while, U.S. spending across all businesses will probably take a hit in the face of increased prices. Eventually, there will be a contraction in the American economy. If there is a slowdown, then energy demand will go down, which could weigh heavily on the business performance of most energy companies.\\n\\nNow, these are still assumptions, and nobody is sure of what is going to happen, thereby fueling ambiguity. Amid the uncertain and turbulent energy business, should energy investors keep a close eye on energy giants like Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corporation?\\n\\nIntegrated Business Model & Strong Balance Sheet to the Rescue\\n\\nIntegrated energy companies are relatively less prone to uncertain business scenarios. This is because when their upstream business suffers from low oil prices, they can keep afloat by banking on their downstream operations. If these companies have strong balance sheets, they can confidently leverage their financial strength to avail loans during uncertain times at favorable rates, maintaining their operational stability even during turbulent times.\\n\\n2 Must-Watch Energy Majors: CVX, XOM\\n\\nChevron\\n\\nChevron, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is among the integrated energy giants with a presence in both the upstream and downstream energy spaces. In the low-cost Permian – the most prolific basin in the United States – CVX has a strong footprint, which will likely aid the company’s production growth in the long run. Chevron’s capital discipline is also noteworthy, as this will pave the way for considerable cash flow generation. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nHowever, CVX can likely navigate the current energy market uncertainty with confidence, backed by its strong balance sheet and integrated business model. Chevron’s debt-to-capitalization is at 13.8%, considerably lower than the 29% of the composite stocks belonging to the industry.\\n\\nExxonMobil\\n\\nExxonMobil is the largest non-government integrated energy company in the world. In the prolific Permian and Guyana resources, XOM has a solid pipeline of profitable projects, securing a healthy production outlook.\\n\\nXOM with a Zacks Rank of 3 also has a strong balance sheet that it can rely on to sail through the current turbulent tariff-induced business environment. ExxonMobil’s debt-to-capitalization is 13.4%, which is also at a very low level and, hence, is significantly below the industry.\\n\\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\\n\\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.\\n\\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\\n\\nSee Stocks Free >>\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nZacks Investment Research\\n\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\n\\nhttps://www.zacks.com\\n\\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

Trump has not yet announced any commitment to ease the 17% tariffs he levied on Israeli imports, however.\\n\\nEuropean Union: The EU started imposing on some U.S. imports Wednesday morning—after suggesting it wanted to negotiate, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen Monday that Europe has offered Trump “zero-for-zero” tariffs on industrial goods and the EU is “always ready for a good deal.” Trump suggested he was unlikely to take that deal, however, telling reporters Monday whether that was a good enough offer for him, “No it’s not. The EU has been very tough over the years.” Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will visit the U.S. on April 17 to lead negotiations, Leavitt said Tuesday.\\n\\nJapan: Trump has asked his administration to start negotiations with the Japanese government, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Monday, after Trump said he Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and the leader was “sending a top team [to the U.S.] to negotiate” on tariffs. Ishiba previously he would urge Trump to drop his 24% tariffs on Japanese imports and would present a negotiation “package” that could include concessions to the U.S. on liquefied natural gas, cars, agriculture and national security.\\n\\nBangladesh: The Bangladeshi government asked the Trump administration on Monday to pause its 37% tariffs on the country’s goods for three months, Bloomberg , as the country pledges to “substantially increase” its imports of American products.\\n\\nCambodia: Cambodia’s commerce ministry to the Trump administration pledging to cut tariffs on its U.S. imports from 35% to 5% after Trump levied 49% tariffs on the nation—a major manufacturer of some American products, like shoes—if the U.S. opens discussions on lowering Trump’s tariffs.\\n\\nUnited Kingdom: British officials believe they could reach a deal to remove or reduce Trump’s 10% tariffs on the U.K. “within weeks,” to The Washington Post, as the government has already been in negotiations with the Trump administration, offering to lower tariffs on U.S. goods and preparing to offer a lower tax rate for American companies in the U.K.\\n\\nVietnam: In a letter Saturday, Vietnam’s Communist Party to remove all tariffs on U.S. goods in hopes of lowering the 46% tax Trump imposed for Vietnamese imports, in exchange for the Trump administration pausing its tariffs on the country’s exports by at least 45 days, and the country’s deputy prime minister traveled to the U.S. with a delegation Sunday in order to negotiate, to The New York Times.\\n\\nIndia: Indian officials have suggested they’re likely to try and negotiate with Trump rather than impose any major retaliatory moves, with an unnamed official telling the country is “seeking dialogue and not confrontation.”\\n\\nTaiwan: President Lai Ching-te said Sunday Taiwan will not impose any retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports and he wants to negotiate with the Trump administration with a goal of “zero tariffs” between the U.S. and Taiwan, Reuters , with the leader also pledging to increase Taiwan’s U.S. investments.\\n\\nIndonesia: Indonesia’s chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto said Sunday the country will pursue a diplomatic solution to the 32% tariffs Trump levied on the nation’s goods rather than imposing retaliatory tariffs, Reuters reports, and the country is planning to send a delegation to the U.S. to negotiate with Trump.\\n\\nLesotho: Trump levied crippling 50% tariffs on the tiny landlocked African country, whose textile industry provides denim to top American brands like Levi’s—and Lesotho’s government is planning to send a delegation to Washington as soon as this week to negotiate, The Washington Post .\\n\\nAustralia: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has decried Trump’s 10% tariffs on the country as being unfair—given that Australia does not levy any tariffs on U.S. goods—but has the government will not impose any retaliatory tariffs in response, Tuesday the country will increase its trade in the Asia-Pacific region, but will “continue to negotiate, of course, with the United States looking for a better deal for Australia because reciprocal tariffs would, of course, be zero.”\\n\\nArgentina: Argentine President Javier Milei is a Trump ally who received an award for his libertarian agenda at Mar-a-Lago after the tariffs were announced, the Associated Press , and while his government is reportedly hailing the 10% tariff rate Argentina received as being a win compared to other countries, the country’s trade minister and Trump’s trade representative Jamieson Greer have both Milei’s government is engaging in trade negotiations with the White House.\\n\\nHow Long Will The Negotiations Take?\\n\\nBessent has not given a timeline for how long the negotiations could take. The Treasury Secretary said Monday Japan would “get priority” in negotiations “because they came forward very quickly,” but deflected when asked if those negotiations could wrap up even within the next week or two. “Negotiations will be tough,” Bessent said. JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon speculated in an interview with Fox Business Wednesday that trade deals will not be completed quickly, noting “trade deals are very large and very complex” and “can’t be done overnight.”\\n\\nCould Countries Retaliate Against Trump’s Tariffs?\\n\\nMost countries have chosen to start negotiations with the Trump administration rather than levy retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports—other than China, which has levied 84% tariffs on American goods in response to Trump dramatically hiking up the U.S.’ tariffs on Chinese goods to 104%. Foreign governments could be forced to retaliate if they don’t make any progress toward a deal with the Trump administration, however, sources told Wednesday. “We still believe that actually having a negotiation would make more sense, but the problem is that they are not negotiating,” one diplomat said.\\n\\nWill Trump Pause The Tariffs?\\n\\nThere is so far no indication Trump will ease his tariffs despite the economic havoc they’ve caused. Leavitt the possibility of a pause on tariffs Tuesday, saying reports there could be a pause are “fake news,” and Trump told reporters Monday he was “not looking at” pausing the tariffs.\\n\\nSurprising Fact\\n\\nTrump levied tariffs on several uninhabited islands or places with only a few residents, such as the Heard and McDonald Islands, an Australian territory that’s primarily inhabited by penguins. It will likely be more difficult for those nations to reach any negotiations about lowering their tariffs. Lutnick the tariffs on those countries Sunday, claiming to CBS News they were necessary or else other countries could try to use them to get around Trump’s tariffs.\\n\\nWhat Has The Trump Administration Said About Negotiating On Tariffs?\\n\\nTrump’s willingness to negotiate comes as some of his aides had claimed the president was not open to making deals, especially in the short term. Trump “is not going to back off what he announced yesterday. He’s not going to back off,” Lutnick told CNN on Thursday after Trump’s tariffs were announced, also telling , “I don’t think the word exemption is going to be a factor. I don’t think that’s such a thing.” Lutnick maintained that stance Sunday, telling CBS News, “There’s no postponing [the tariffs taking effect], they’re definitely going to stay in place for days or weeks.” Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has similarly suggested the tariffs are not up for discussion, writing in an Monday for the Financial Times, “This is not a negotiation”—even as Trump himself suggested he was willing to make deals hours later. In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Navarro decried what he called “non-tariff cheating” by other countries, suggesting countries will have to make concessions beyond lowering tariffs on U.S. goods in order to get the White House to lower tariffs on their products. “We’re always willing to listen .. if you want to come and talk to us,” Navarro said about other countries negotiating with the U.S.\\n\\nKey Background\\n\\nTrump imposed sweeping tariffs on other countries Wednesday, fulfilling a longtime campaign promise to levy tariffs on foreign goods in an effort to return manufacturing to the U.S. The president’s plan has long been decried by economists, who have warned any tariffs would raise prices for consumers and harm the U.S. economy—a scenario that started playing out after Trump announced his tariffs, as stocks plunged and economists forecasted a recession could now be on the way. Trump has continued to double down on his economic plan despite the chaos his tariffs have caused, telling reporters Monday they are “the only chance our country will have to reset the table” on trade and that while other presidents would not be willing to cause such economic chaos by imposing them, “I don’t mind going through it, because I see a beautiful picture at the end.”\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n\\nForbesTrump And Advisors Offer Contradictory Takes On Tariff Negotiations—What To KnowBy Siladitya Ray ForbesHere’s The Full List Of Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs Announced WednesdayBy Molly Bohannon ForbesTariffs Cause Another Stock Market Rout—Losses Approach $5 Trillion As Dow Plummets Another 2,200 PointsBy Derek Saul Follow me on .\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -57.68137118395637,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:23:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.forbes.com\",\n                \"title\": \"Forbes\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\",\n                \"Europe & Central Asia\",\n                \"Latin America & Caribbean\",\n                \"Sub-Saharan Africa\",\n                \"Middle East & North Africa\",\n                \"South Asia\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -50.8112738272723,\n            \"second_model_score\": -47.64705882352941,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Donald Trump's new tariffs on foreign imports have taken effect, prompting numerous countries to seek negotiations.

Germany is getting a government that is capable and strong.”\\n\\nThe agreement, which comes 45 days after Merz’s conservatives won a snap election, was reached quickly by German standards, as postelection coalition negotiations can often take months.\\n\\nThe deal clears the way for Merz, the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union, to be sworn in as Germany’s next chancellor, likely in early May.\\n\\nThe coalition deal comes at a moment of profound uncertainty for Germany and Europe after Trump last week slapped 20 percent tariffs on the European Union, a move that could hit Germany’s export-oriented economy particularly hard. It also comes as Merz vows to strengthen his country’s military in response to the threat Putin presents to Europe and the weakening of the transatlantic alliance Germany has long depended on for its defense.\\n\\nThese twin shocks — to the economy and European security — intensified pressure on Merz and his SPD counterparts to rapidly form a stable government capable of responding. Germany has been led by a weak minority government under outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose fractious three-party coalition collapsed in November over disagreements on spending.\\n\\n“We conducted the coalition negotiations in a situation of growing global political tensions … in which many forces from within and without are not working with us, but against us in Germany,” Merz said. “The war in Ukraine continues unabated. The Russian aggressor Putin shows no willingness to end the war and silence the weapons, and at the same time the economic uncertainties are increasing enormously.””\\n\\nRecent decisions by the U.S. government “have triggered new turbulence,” he added. “We don’t yet know which direction the international situation will take. But that’s why our message today is all the clearer: We want to and we will help shape change in the world for Germany.”\\n\\nDespite Merz’s pledges to provide strong German leadership within Europe, he emerges from coalition negotiations as a damaged party leader. His landmark agreement with the SPD and the Greens to unleash hundreds of billions of euros in debt-fueled spending for defense and infrastructure was largely celebrated abroad. At home, however, it fomented dissatisfaction within parts of Merz’s conservative base and opened him to attacks from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is set to become the largest opposition party in the country’s parliament. Merz’s approval ratings have plummeted since his conservatives’ election victory.\\n\\nEconomic competitiveness and migration\\n\\nThe final phase of negotiations between the conservatives and the SPD brought several key sticking points to the surface on issues such as tax cuts, the economy and migration.\\n\\nMerz said the compromise agreement will strengthen Germany’s “price competitiveness” by using tax cuts and tax incentives for investment in equipment, adding that the new government will reduce corporate income tax by one percent annually in five equal steps as of 2028. In order to bring down the high cost of electricity in Germany, Merz said the coalition will reduce the electricity tax to the European minimum, cut grid fees and introduce an industrial electricity price.\\n\\nIt was migration, however, that emerged as one of the most politically charged issues late in the talks. Facing pressure from his right flank due to the AfD’s strong election result, Merz’s conservatives pushed for asylum-seekers to be rejected at Germany’s borders. The SPD argued against the move, saying it would alienate Germany’s neighbors at a time when the country needed EU solidarity to combat Trump’s tariffs.\\n\\nIn the end, the two sides reached a deal that appeared to avoid the most radical proposals but still struck a much harder line, with Merz vowing to “largely put an end to irregular migration” with controls at national borders, including “rejections of asylum seekers.” The incoming chancellor also said the government would launch a “repatriation offensive,” suspend family reunification, and increase the number of nations Germany considers safe countries of origin.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Lars Klingbeil, one of the SPD’s national leaders, noted that the agreement preserves what he called the “fundamental right” to asylum and maintains Germany’s status as a “country of immigration.”\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -55.55553568734063,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:38:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.politico.eu\",\n                \"title\": \"politico.eu\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\",\n                \"Europe & Central Asia\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -35.33332339922587,\n            \"second_model_score\": -13.333333333333336,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Industrials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Friedrich Merz's conservatives and the SPD swiftly formed a coalition government in Germany, aiming to tackle challenges like Trump's trade war and Putin's threat.

After he orders a vodka martini up with an olive and some garlic cheese bread (“Even though it probably will be on the list of things I discuss with my oncologist”), Wyle launches into an anecdote about the time he arrived at the Smoke House with George Clooney, Anthony Edwards and Eriq La Salle, all in costume, with Edwards’ young son, Bailey, in tow.\\n\\n“Bailey started to choke on a french fry, and the four of us fucking panicked,” he says with a raspy cackle. “A busboy walked over and stuck his finger in Bailey’s mouth and fished it out, and the rest of the restaurant got treated to four guys in scrubs and white coats looking like Keystone Cops.”\\n\\nFor the first time since the end of his 15-year, 254-episode run as Dr. John Carter, Wyle is wearing scrubs again: On the hit Max series “The Pitt,” he plays beleaguered Pittsburgh emergency room physician Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch. The weekly rollout of the show’s buzzy first season, which concludes on April 10, has proven that a streaming service can sustain a network-style medical drama with a 15-episode count and familiar disease- and injury-of-the-week storytelling rhythms. The show’s engrossing real-time format (each episode unfolds in a single location in a single hour within the same day) and unflinching depiction of ER trauma (physical and emotional) have elevated it to the thick of the Emmy conversation alongside the likes of “Severance” and “The White Lotus.”\\n\\nThe critical acclaim and enthusiastic reception have also placed Wyle at the center of a cultural phenomenon for the first time since the height of “ER” mania in the mid-1990s, when the drama could command upwards of 35 million viewers a week. While Max isn’t releasing audience data for “The Pitt” — the streamer says the show “ranks among the top 3 most watched Max series in platform history” — it has definitively pierced through the chaos of everything in this horrid year with storylines that range from harrowing (teenage fentanyl overdoses, a violently abusive patient, a mass shooting) to hilarious (a stolen ambulance, contaminated face cream, rats on the ER floor).\\n\\n“It feels similar, except this time I know the circus,” Wyle, now 53, says of the receptions to “The Pitt” and “ER.” “This time, there are no surprises under this big top.”\\n\\nBut as an executive producer and writer as well as the star, Wyle is both ringmaster and main attraction, a position of heightened prominence he’s never experienced in his 35-year career. He’s not accustomed to this much sustained and concentrated attention — he estimates he’s given at least 100 interviews since “The Pitt” premiered in January — and, more to the point, it makes him visibly uncomfortable.\\n\\n“I love being part of the conversation,” he says, looking away. “I’m not crazy about being the one doing all the talking.”\\n\\nEven so, during our long dinner, Wyle is never less than a lively, engaging conversationalist, quick to laugh at himself and heap praise on his colleagues and collaborators. The puppy-dog charisma that earned him unthreatening-heartthrob status at 23 has seasoned into a self-effacing, paternal affability. A father of three, he’s the kind of guy who can make his peak dadcore outfit — relaxed-fit blue jeans, a dark blue zippered fleece jacket and a well-traveled backpack — seem cool.\\n\\n“I watched Noah as a young man go through this complete loss of his anonymity,” says John Wells, executive producer of “ER” and “The Pitt.” “He has dealt with it by becoming open and curious and available to people, which not everybody does. He’s very intelligent, very well read and fantastically empathetic. Honestly, he’s one of the great human beings in my life.”\\n\\nWhat Wyle isn’t on this particular evening, however, is terribly observant.\\n\\n“This martini went straight to my head,” he says roughly halfway through our conversation. “I have no idea what we’ve talked about all night.” He leans toward my recorder and says in a singsong voice: “Plausible deniability!”\\n\\nIt’s not until our interview is winding down, and he excuses himself to run to the restroom, that the reason we’ve been talking — about why he decided to play a doctor again, about how he fostered an uncommonly collaborative set, even about being sued by the estate of “ER” creator Michael Crichton — finally hits him. When he comes back to our table, he’s already laughing.\\n\\n“It suddenly dawned on me in the bathroom: ‘Noah, I think this is about you.’”\\n\\nAs the world was just starting to retreat into lockdown in 2020, Wyle began getting DMs on Instagram from first responders overwhelmed by the first lethal waves of COVID-19. Some simply thanked Wyle for inspiring them to pursue a medical career with his performance on “ER.” But most of the messages were laced with an unmistakable desperation about the precarious state of the country’s health care workers — and how no one was telling their story.\\n\\n“They were saying things like, ‘Carter, where are you?’” he says. “‘It’s really hard out here.’”\\n\\nWyle, meanwhile, was confronting his own pandemic-fed crisis. “I joke in a way that isn’t funny that in 2020 I was thinking aspirationally about having a nervous breakdown, but couldn’t figure out when to schedule it,” he says. “I just thought the world was coming apart. I didn’t know how to contribute anything of meaning or value anymore.”\\n\\nIn the decade following the “ER” finale in 2009, Wyle’s career happily chugged along largely on a pair of genre shows for TNT, “Falling Skies” and “The Librarians.” “I wouldn’t take a script if it was to play a doctor, even if it was a veterinarian,” he says. “The idea of putting a stethoscope around my neck just seemed like a really bad idea.”\\n\\nScrolling through DM after DM, however, ignited a new sense of purpose in Wyle. When he was on “ER,” he’d channeled his personal experiences with Kosovo war refugees into storylines set in Congo and Sudan. “The light bulb that went off for me was, I could use Carter the way I used to use Carter — to talk about how I feel now,” he says.\\n\\nAs he takes another sip of his martini, Wyle expands on a theme he returns to again and again: His bone-deep, lifelong reverence for medical professionals, born as much from his charity work and his mother’s career as an orthopedic nurse as from his time on “ER.”\\n\\n“These people sacrifice so much in the service of others that I find it absolutely infuriating that their expertise is being called into question,” he says, leavening his irritation with a chuckle, his voice never growing louder than his usual calming timbre. “I find it infuriating that we still can’t come to a consensus that masks cut down on transmission of disease. I find it infuriating that we still won’t acknowledge that vaccines are an important way of eradicating disease. I find it all infuriating that we are where we are right now. So I wanted to make a show that brings back into sharp focus what an objective medical fact is.”\\n\\nOver the next few years — as Wyle joined the cast of the crime dramedy “Leverage: Redemption” for Amazon’s Freevee — Wyle, Wells and former “ER” showrunner R. Scott Gemmill traded messages and had Zoom calls about the possibility of bringing John Carter back to television. “It would look a lot more like a small character piece centered around Carter 15 years later, dropping in on him wherever he was to make a jeremiad scream from the mountaintop about what was happening,” Wyle says.\\n\\nGemmill was particularly keen to take advantage of all the “ER” footage of Carter as a med student as a way to capture the full toll of a life spent in emergency medicine. “That would’ve been a unique show, to be able to see Noah at 23 and then flash-forward to when he’s 52 or 53 and see that dichotomy,” he says. “Whether it would have worked or not, I don’t know. But it would have been a fun experiment.”\\n\\nThe “ER” revival “got pretty close to being a reality,” Wyle says, but it fell apart when Warner Bros. Television couldn’t come to terms with the Crichton’s estate, which was overseen by his widow, Sherri Crichton. But Wyle’s determination to put a spotlight back on first responders hadn’t dimmed, and to his surprise, Max still wanted to make a medical series with him even if he wasn’t playing Dr. Carter. Once the writers strike concluded in the fall of 2023, the team rapidly put together what ultimately became “The Pitt.” By July 2024, they were filming on the Warner Bros. lot.\\n\\nThe next month, Crichton sued Wells, Gemmill, Wyle and Warner Bros. TV for breach of contract. She alleged that “The Pitt” was nothing more than an “ER” revival, “just under a different name” to escape their obligation to give her late husband a “created by” credit, which the suit calls “a shameful betrayal of [Michael] Crichton and his legacy.”\\n\\nWhen I ask Wyle about the suit, his eyes dim. He’s silent for a long time, stabbing his fork into his salad. “The only thing that I can legally speak to,” he says finally, “is how I feel emotionally, which is just profoundly sad and disappointed. This taints the legacy, and it shouldn’t have. At one point, this could have been a partnership. And when it wasn’t a partnership, it didn’t need to turn acrimonious. But on the 30th anniversary of ‘ER,’ I’ve never felt less celebratory of that achievement than I do this year.”\\n\\nWyle stresses that once an “ER” reboot was a nonstarter, “we pivoted as far in the opposite direction as we could in order to tell the story we wanted to tell — and not for litigious reasons, but because we didn’t want to retread our own creative work.”\\n\\nSince the blue-blooded and diffident Dr. Carter came from extreme wealth and privilege, they decided Dr. Robby would be a self-assured, working-class Jew with a biting temper. Since “ER” employed elaborate, cinematic camerawork and a propulsive score, “The Pitt” unfolds like a no-frills docudrama under unforgiving fluorescent lighting and with virtually no music. Most crucially, the real-time structure of “The Pitt” sets it apart from just about every other medical TV series, past or present.\\n\\n“We really wanted to find something new for ourselves,” Wyle says. “And in some ways, that’s what was so disheartening about the whole thing. We really felt like we’d done it.”\\n\\nThere is at least one aspect of “ER” that Wyle did strive to re-create on “The Pitt”: the camaraderie he built over hundreds of episodes with his cast and crew, something that can only happen on a long-running drama series with more than 12 episodes per season. “We see each other fall in love, get married, have children, get divorced,” Wyle says. “Those relationships transcend the screen and become palpable to an audience who wants to be part of that family. I’ve tried to create it in every job I’ve gone on, but with varying degrees of success.”\\n\\nAs an executive producer from the start, Wyle could for the first time establish the environment of his show from the ground up. Along with their audition sides, prospective actors received a “mission statement” Wyle wrote about the caliber of performers he was seeking. Isa Briones, who plays the cocky intern Dr. Trinity Santos, remembers Wyle’s note as a kind of challenge. “‘This is a very specific type of show,’” she recalls reading in the mission statement. “‘It’s intense. It’s fast-paced. It’s like theater. We are a group of players. If you can be a team player who is ready to lock in with a family, then this is the place for you.’ I was like, ‘Oh, wow, this is the first I’m really getting to know of this man. And already I love it.’”\\n\\n“Noah’s coming in as, really, the cast boss,” Wells says. “He sets a level of professionalism that he wasn’t in a position to do when we were doing ‘ER.’”\\n\\nThe nature of the production on “The Pitt,” which was shot almost entirely in continuity, demanded everyone remain ready to be on camera at any moment, no matter where they were on the set — an exacting approach that Wyle embraced. “You might be the star of the show, but you’re going to spend three hours being a fuzzy blob in the background of somebody else’s scene,” says Patrick Ball, who plays Robby’s protégé, Dr. Frank Langdon. “Noah set the tone for that. We stayed on set pretty much all day. I feel very lucky for the guidance that he gave me.”\\n\\nBefore production began, the cast spent two weeks learning how to perform intricate emergency medical techniques for the camera with the convincing speed and facility of actual professionals. “The doctors training us would say, ‘Noah, do you want to get up and show how you do it?’” Briones says. “But then Noah would also always say, ‘If someone else has a great idea, I’m stealing it.’ One time, I was like, ‘I’m going to try this version of faking the compressions.’ And he was like, ‘Wait, that’s really good.’ And I was like, ‘I win!’”\\n\\nEven speaking the word “mentor” to Wyle, however, causes him to roll his eyes with startling intensity.\\n\\n“It presupposes that I am a mentor to these young performers,” he says. I tell him that’s pretty much exactly how Briones and Ball characterized him to me. “Neither one of those performers need mentors,” he says with not a little exasperation. “Neither one of those performers should look to me as anything other than their scene partner. They’re doing fine!”\\n\\nBriones also singled out Wyle for his generosity with the background actors. Because cellphones were banned from set, she says, Wyle “would always go around and be like, ‘What are you reading right now?’” The show even started a lending library next to craft services, to which, Briones adds, Wyle donated a bunch of books.\\n\\nSo I ask Wyle about it.\\n\\n“What outside sources have you been speaking to, Adam?”\\n\\nWell, who started the library?\\n\\n“I don’t know,” he says, slowly shaking his head. “Some incredibly noble and generous person. I can’t even imagine who would think of such a thing.”\\n\\nSo did you start it?\\n\\n“The variety of books was astonishing,” he says, ignoring my question. “There was everything from the classics to modern releases. One woman kept the entire anthology of ‘Harry Potter’ inside of her pregnancy belly.”\\n\\nOK, can you at least talk about the titles you donated to the library?\\n\\n“I remember thinking if I was going to bring books in, I was concerned about anything that could introduce conflict or acrimony into a harmonious set,” he says. “So I went with books that I thought would be enjoyed by the most amount of people.” He stops himself and smiles at me. “If I did it, but because that would be foolish for me to do, I didn’t do it.”\\n\\nI regard Wyle for a beat as he takes another sip of his martini and tries to avoid my gaze. Of everything I’ve asked him, why is this the topic he seems to find the most embarrassing to talk about?\\n\\n“You’re asking me to take credit for something,” he says. “I don’t like taking credit for anything.” He leans toward my recorder again. “You’re not getting me on the record. It wasn’t me, officer.”\\n\\nThe first season of “The Pitt” reaches its climax in Episode 13, as Dr. Robby oversees a torrent of critical patients from a mass shooting at a local music festival. The pressures that have piled onto him all day — especially his unresolved PTSD from the pandemic, when he had to take his mentor off life support — finally reach a breaking point, and in an aria of uncontrollable anguish, Robby’s face flushes and he crumples onto the floor, overcome with ragged, heaving sobs. It is a breathtaking feat of high-wire acting, and, to my surprise, Wyle lights up when I tell him so.\\n\\n“I don’t like speaking immodestly, but occasionally I know that I’m good at something and I want to give myself the credit for the technique I’ve been able to build up over the last 35 years,” he says. “That’s when I feel like Kobe Bryant. I get giddy when I’m given an opportunity to show off like that.”\\n\\nThen, just as quickly, he redirects the spotlight back to his mission for “The Pitt,” to the first responders who still share with him their vivid horror stories of those unspeakable months in the spring of 2020.\\n\\n“That breakdown scene was why I wanted to do the show,” he says. “I wanted to make a show about a health practitioner that we invest a tremendous amount of trust and belief and admiration in. And when the shit hits the fan, we are expecting that white knight to come charging in on his horse. Then the horse comes in without its rider, and we don’t know where the hero is, and it’s because …”\\n\\nHis voice breaks. “He’s on the floor,” he says, dropping to a whisper. “He’s on the floor. And how do we get off the floor? How do we admit the fact that we break? How do we rebuild?”\\n\\nThose are questions Wyle hopes to examine in Season 2. He’s already in the writers’ room, and will start shooting again in June for a January 2026 premiere — Max intends for “The Pitt” to return every year. The current plan is for Season 2 to take place roughly ten months after the events of Season 1, when Dr. Robby “no longer is able to pretend to himself that he doesn’t need help,” Wyle says.\\n\\nJust don’t expect Robby to suddenly be well adjusted either. “In a perfect world, this show goes several seasons, so we don’t have to rush this process,” Wyle says. “It’s a really interesting road that he’s about to embark on.”\\n\\nCould Wyle see “The Pitt” running as long as “ER” did?\\n\\n“I don’t know whether we can go 15,” he says. “What would that make me? 68? ‘Dr. Robby, you have to retire!’”\\n\\nStyling: Maryam Malakpour/The Only Agency; Styling assistant: Yurga Juozapa; Grooming: Johnny Hernandez/Fierro/Dior Backstage; Look 1 (cover) Blazer and trousers: Lardini; Shirt: God’s True Cashmere: Tank: Amiri; Shoes: Churches; Look 2 (in elevator): Full look: Saint Laurent; Look 3 (green overshirt) Over shirt: God’s True Cashmere; T-shirt: Frame; Pants: Sunspel; Look 4 (red sweater): Jacket and pants: Sunspel; Sweater: Frame; Shoes: Churches; Look 5 (elevator with sunglasses) Full look: Saint Laurent; Sunglasses: Oliver Peoples\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 66.6584332784017,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://variety.com\",\n                \"title\": \"Variety\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\",\n                \"Europe & Central Asia\",\n                \"Sub-Saharan Africa\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 44.16254997253418,\n            \"second_model_score\": 30,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Communication Services\",\n                \"Financials\",\n                \"Health Care\",\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Noah Wyle, known for his role as Dr. Carter in \\\"ER,\\\" is back in scrubs in the Max series \\\"The Pitt.\\\" The show's real-time format and unflinching portrayal of ER trauma have garnered critical acclaim, placing Wyle back in the spotlight.

Anyone who is found to be acting in this manner will be removed from the screening and not entitled to a refund.”\\n\\nThe Radway in Sidmouth posted a similar warning on its social media page saying: “Anyone found taking part in the current social media trend involving A Minecraft Movie will be removed from the cinema. We wish for our customers to enjoy the experience they have paid for.” The Reel in Rochdale said the police would be called “where necessary”.\\n\\nCineworld, one of the UK’s largest cinema chains, is attempting to steer more vocal Minecraft fans towards specially created screenings. It has announced “one-off” showings this weekend giving filmgoers the chance to dress up as Minecraft characters and “let your hair down” and encouraged “shouting ‘chicken jockey’ as you see fit!” on those occasions.\\n\\nHowever, the chain asked people attending the screenings on 13 April in its 4DX format – which includes effects such as strobe lighting and movable seats – to not go “full creeper”, referring to a villainous creature in the Minecraft game that can hurt or kill players.\\n\\n“No mess please, just good clean fun,” said Cineworld in a statement advertising the screenings.\\n\\nIn the US, the Township theatre in Washington, New Jersey has banned unaccompanied minors from attending screenings of the film after what it called an “unfortunate situation” on 4 April. In a social media post, it said: “Large groups of unsupervised boys engaged in completely unacceptable behaviour, including vandalism … Moving forward: Any minors wishing to see The Minecraft Movie MUST be accompanied by a parent or responsible adult. Unaccompanied groups of boys will not be admitted.”\\n\\nIt added: “If your son was at Township theatre last night, we strongly encourage you to have a conversation with him about his behaviour.”\\n\\nDespite incidents of rowdy behaviour across cinemas in the US and UK, it was business as usual at a Cineworld in Didsbury, Manchester on Wednesday. At a couple of early afternoon screenings of the film starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa during the school Easter holidays, the viral scene was met with silence, with cinema staff saying they had not experienced any rowdy or antisocial behaviour.\\n\\nFor Luke Halil, 29, and Carla Gouveia, 24, who came to watch the film with their young son, it was a peaceful experience. The couple said they were familiar with the “chicken jockey” trend but had not expected any unusual behaviour, as they had booked an early afternoon viewing.\\n\\n“It was really quiet. The film were good,” Gouveia said. “I think because of the time of day, it was less likely to be how it has been. If you were to come in the evening you probably would witness more of that kind of behaviour.”\\n\\nIn 2022 TikTok was at the centre of another disruptive cinema trend when some audience members disrupted screenings of Minions: The Rise of Gru, prompting some UK cinemas to ban groups of young people turning up for screenings in fancy dress.\\n\\nA Minecraft Movie has proved unexpectedly successful at the box office, scoring the highest ever opening weekend for a video game adaptation in North America, and amassing about $314m across the world.

He said he was talking trash back and forth with a fan, but the officials thought he was directing abuse at a referee and he was ejected after picking up a second technical foul.\\n\\n“If [the fan is] going to talk, I’m going to talk back, like always,” said Dončić. “That had nothing to do with the ref. So I didn’t really understand.”\\n\\nThe crew chief, Tony Brothers, said Dončić had “looked directly at an official and used vulgar language.”\\n\\nThe fan in question, Jeremy Price, he believed Dončić was shouting at him rather than a referee. “During the game within the game, I mentioned that he was short [on his shot] and he missed it, and he turned around and he shot an expletive back and [the referee] happened to see it and, at that point, T’d him up,” Price said. The ejection affected the trajectory of the game. The Thunder outscored the Lakers 29-12 the rest of the way.\\n\\n“I mean, it was tough,” Dončić said. “I mean, we were right there. I think we fought the whole game. … We came back in the third quarter. We were fighting, man. So it was tough to see that with this kind of situation to happen. And you know, that’s on me too, so I can’t let my team down like that.” Now, Dončić can focus on the Mavericks – the team he led to the NBA finals just last season after winning the scoring title. The five-time All-Star was among those who were shocked when he was traded for Anthony Davis in February.\\n\\nThough Dončić says he has bonded with his new teammates, he looks forward to being back in Dallas.\\n\\n“Of course that’s going to be a lot of emotion for me,” he said. “Like, how do we know what to expect? I don’t know how I’m going to feel, honestly. I’m looking forward to being back in Dallas. Obviously, with the fans, seeing my teammates – ex-teammates – it’s going to be a very emotional for me, for sure.”\\n\\nDončić is averaging 27.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.6 assists in 26 games with the Lakers.

You’ve got to be able to show different defenses, and that’s even hard.

Their team was still in eighth place, fighting to move out of the play-in spots in the NBA’s playoff race, and was three games above .500.\\n\\nWhen they woke up the next morning, the sky was falling.\\n\\nAt 12:12 a.m. ET on February 2, that Luka Dončić – the Mavericks’ 25-year-old megastar who was expected to be the cornerstone of their franchise for the next decade or more – was being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. The news stunned a city.\\n\\n“I woke up at like three in the morning and just saw a notification on my phone and rolled over and looked at it and said, ‘Oh my gosh!’” Dallas fan John Tarrant told CNN Sports. “Of course, that scared my wife … she goes, ‘What’s wrong?’ I said, ‘The Mavs traded Luka!’ And I think she rolled over and went back to sleep.”\\n\\nWhen he had to share the news with his boys in the morning – their favorite player, whose numbers they wear on their own basketball jerseys and whose pennants adorn their walls – they were in disbelief.\\n\\n“I just said, ‘You’re joking,’ and went back to sleep,” Hank Tarrant said.\\n\\n“I was shocked, and I thought that you were joking,” Sam Tarrant added.\\n\\nDončić makes his first trip back to Dallas on Wednesday night when the Lakers play the Mavs, a trip that’s sure to be filled with emotion – for Dončić, his teammates and the thousands of fans in the arena who have been angry with Mavericks leadership for trading away a fan favorite superstar.\\n\\nRarely has a team’s season hinged on one self-inflicted move. In the more than six weeks since the deal, the Mavericks have gone 12-18, lost Anthony Davis – the main player they received in return for Dončić – for weeks due to injury in his first game with the team, lost talisman Kyrie Irving to a season-ending ACL injury and watched a slew of other players go down hurt. At the same time, they’ve been watching their former star settle in LA alongside LeBron James and the rest of Hollywood’s elite.\\n\\nIt all amounts to potentially the worst in-season stretch for any American sports fanbase in modern history. A bright future suddenly seems dark and uncertain, a franchise icon is now getting used to beaches and palm trees and the best players left on the team are on the sideline instead of the court.\\n\\nThe response from Mavs fans: a mix of despondency and rebellion. Fans are booing their team, chanting for general manager Nico Harrison to be fired and – unbelievably, for some of them – buying Lakers jerseys and starting to follow Dončić’s new team.\\n\\n“I’m always gonna be a Mavs fan, they’re our local team. But will I be as emotionally invested in them? It’s going to take a lot of rebuilding and rebuilding our trust in the franchise going forward,” John Tarrant told CNN.\\n\\nAnger at Harrison\\n\\nThe team’s general manager, the man who orchestrated the deal, has taken the brunt of the criticism.\\n\\nChants of “Fire Nico!” have broken out all over Dallas – a video on X even showed people chanting it at a local . News that came out of the Mavericks organization after the trade slammed Dončić’s conditioning, with citing sources inside the franchise revealing frustration with his diet.\\n\\nThe treatment of a player who was widely revered as an icon in Dallas, especially less than a year after an NBA Finals appearance, went over like a ton of bricks.\\n\\n“Everyone wants to point at Luka’s flaws, at least for a half-second,” Mavs fan Matthew Slovak told CNN. “The overwhelming narrative is that this is the most ridiculous thing ever, but there was that, ‘Yeah, but.’ There is no ‘yeah, but.’ – this is the most indefensible trade of all time.”\\n\\nIn a , Harrison defended the move as a prudent one that improved the team’s defense and also got ahead of potentially messy contract negotiation.\\n\\n“There are some unique things about his contract that we had to pay attention to. There are other teams that were loading up … He was going to be able to decide, make his own decision at some point of whether he wants to be here or not, whether we want a supermax him or not, or whether he wants to opt out,” Harrison said. “I think we had to take all that into consideration and feel like we got out in front of what could have been a tumultuous summer.”\\n\\nIt’s safe to say Harrison’s justification for the deal did not convince many – nor did his trade of Quentin Grimes to the Philadelphia 76ers as the guard has caught fire in the City of Brotherly Love.\\n\\n“You just have no reason to believe in anything that they might throw at us because it just doesn’t make sense,” said Dallas fan Skylar Alcala. “It will never make sense.”\\n\\nA weight on the team and on the fans\\n\\nThe negative energy around the Mavericks is palpable. Fans are booing, they’re mouthing the words “Fire Nico!’ when they get on the big screen during games and they’re holding protests outside the stadium.\\n\\nAnd the players are noticing. Forward PJ Washington responded angrily to a fan who yelled for Harrison to lose his job while the Dallas player was shooting a free throw.\\n\\n“At the end of the day, the trade happened. We understand we have a new team now. All that ‘Fire Nico’ stuff, we’re sick and tired of hearing it. We just want to go out there and play and the fans to support us,” he said.\\n\\nWashington’s sentiments are understandable, given that the source of the fans’ ire is the front office rather than the players on the court. But it’s not exactly certain that the Mavs fan base is ready to go quiet now.\\n\\nAnd if they do, it may be more due to apathy than to heeding their team’s call for support.\\n\\n“It will probably take until Luka is out of the NBA completely because the NBA was my favorite sport,” Slovak said of whether he can fully support the team. “And to have that happen to your favorite team, favorite sport – you gotta have those painful memories out of the league before you can start to rebuild.”\\n\\nAs strong as the bond between a team and a fan can be, the bond between a fan and a favorite player can sometimes be even stronger. There are now a not-insignificant number of Mavs fans watching Lakers games on NBA League Pass and paying more attention to how Dončić is doing than they are with their Mavericks, even as they struggle to hold on to a possible play-in spot.\\n\\n“He was ours,” Tarrant told CNN. “We loved Luka, and I would love to see him win a championship, but I hate that it’s going to be the purple-and-gold when he does that.”\\n\\nAlcala admitted she’s even crossed a line she never thought she’d face: a new Dončić Lakers jersey arrived in the mail not long ago for her son.\\n\\n“I can’t believe I bought that,” she said.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -58.823319042430214,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 11:16:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.cnn.com\",\n                \"title\": \"CNN\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -42.73518893297981,\n            \"second_model_score\": -22.941176470588236,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Dallas Mavericks fans are in turmoil after the shocking trade of superstar Luka Dončić to the Lakers.

Neither Wilson nor Winston is a long-term answer. However, the additions mean the Giants can at least toy with passing on the quarterbacks in Round 1 in favor of one of the class's top two prospects. Travis Hunter is off the board, but Carter would take this New York defense to new heights.\\n\\n\\\"In his first season as a full-time edge rusher (after playing primarily off-ball linebacker in past years), Carter had 12 sacks and 23.5 total tackles for loss. I see elite traits on the tape. And considering the Giants have holes all over their roster, they might opt for the best player on the board. They'd have something with Carter, Brian Burns, Kayvon Thibodeauxand Dexter Lawrence II up front.\\\"\\n\\nAs Kiper mentioned, Kiper primarily lined up at off-ball linebacker in his first two seasons at Penn State, totaling 11.0 sacks, 17 tackles for loss, nine passes defensed, one interception, and three forced fumbles to go with his 104 total tackles (61 solo). He earned second-team All-Big Ten honors from the media both seasons, while being tabbed first-team all-conference by the Big Ten coaches in 2023.\\n\\nCarter then transitioned to a full-time edge rusher this past season and put together a breakout campaign. The 6-foot-3, 250-pound pass rusher picked up 12.0 sacks and a nation-high 23.5 tackles for loss, as Kiper mentioned, along with two forced fumbles and four passes defensed, on his way to being named Unanimous All-American and first-team all-conference.\\n\\nHe was also selected as the Nagurski-Woodson Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and the Smith-Brown Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year.\\n\\nCarter registered 10 games with two or more tackles for loss out of 42 total contests (35 starts).\\n\\nView photos of 2025 NFL Draft prospect Abdul Carter, edge rusher out of Penn State.\\n\\n1 / 98\\n\\n2 / 98\\n\\nPenn State linebacker Abdul Carter (11) blocks a pass by Michigan State quarterback Payton Thorne (10) during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022, in State College, Pa.

All rights reserved\\n\\nAdvertising\\n\\nThis Ad will close in 3\\n\\nMoving to the second round, Kiper has the Giants addressing the quarterback position here with the selection of Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe.\\n\\n\\\"After the Giants passed on Shedeur Sanders in Round 1, they could come back to the quarterbacks on Day 2,\\\" the ESPN draft analyst wrote. \\\"There is some love for Milroe in NFL circles right now, and he could fit well in New York. He'd have the chance to learn behind Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston, developing his pre-snap reads and improving his short-to-intermediate accuracy. Milroe throws a great deep ball and can change a game with his legs. He ran for 20 scores in 2024.\\\"\\n\\nMilroe started 26 games under center for the Crimson Tide across the last two seasons. As a redshirt sophomore in 2023, the 6-foot-2, 217-pound quarterback completed 65.8 percent of his passes for 2,834 yards, 23 touchdowns and six interceptions while adding 12 rushing touchdowns. This led to him being named second-team All-SEC and finishing sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting.\\n\\nAcross 13 games this past season, Milroe finished with 2,844 passing yards, a 64.3 completion percentage, 16 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, but scored a whopping 20 rushing touchdowns.\\n\\nMilroe participated in Alabama's Pro Day recently, where he put together an impressive performance. His Next Gen Stats athleticism score of 99 ranks No. 1 among all quarterbacks in the 2025 NFL Draft.\\n\\nMilroe is the fifth quarterback taken in Kiper's two-round mock draft.\\n\\nHere is where Kiper projected all five of those signal-callers:\\n\\n1. Tennessee Titans - Cam Ward, Miami 9. New Orleans Saints - Shedeur Sanders, Colorado 26. Los Angeles Rams - Jaxson Dart, Mississippi 33. Cleveland Browns - Tyler Shough, Louisville 34.

The cosmic weirdness could be explained by the gravitational effects of a large planet.\\n\\nBut no one has actually spotted Planet 9. It's so far away, it would be a faint object, and the swath of sky that researchers have to search is huge.\\n\\nNow, though, researchers are close to finally starting up a powerful astronomical facility that's on a mountaintop in Chile. The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a joint project of the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, has been under construction for years — and later this month workers are expected to finally start the commissioning and fine-tuning of its instruments.\\n\\nBrown says he couldn't have asked for a better telescope to hunt his celestial quarry.\\n\\n\\\"If you were to hand me a big wad of cash and say, 'Go build a telescope to go either find this Planet 9 or find the best evidence possible for Planet 9,' I would probably go and build the Vera Rubin Observatory,\\\" says Brown. \\\"It really is a telescope that is perfectly suited for making the next step.\\\"\\n\\nThe best bet\\n\\n, Rubin's director of operations, says the observatory will survey almost the entire southern sky every night, taking pictures as it goes with the biggest digital in the world.\\n\\n\\\"The telescope itself is a big telescope, so it can see really faint objects,\\\" says Blum.\\n\\nWhat's more, the observatory's images will feed into computer systems that will constantly be comparing the new images to previous ones. That will allow the observatory to detect anything that changes — like, say, Planet Nine moving across the sky.\\n\\n\\\"If it's there, we should be able to find it, pretty easily,\\\" says Blum.\\n\\nThe observatory will be a game-changer in the hunt for Planet 9, agrees of Carnegie Science, one of the researchers who first suggested that a big planet could be the culprit that was messing with the orbits of some small solar system bodies.\\n\\n\\\"Vera Rubin is our best bet to find it in the next few years, probably,\\\" says Sheppard. \\\"It's going to turn over more rocks than anyone has turned over before.\\\"\\n\\nIf Planet 9 is real, this observatory has around a 70 to 80 percent chance of finding it, he estimates, adding that it's not a sure thing because there are so many uncertainties.\\n\\n\\\"We don't know the size of the planet. We don't know the reflectivity of the planet. We don't know the distance of the planet,\\\" says Sheppard. \\\"Those three things will determine how bright this planet actually is.\\\"\\n\\nIf Planet 9 is on the smaller side, dark, and really far away, he explains, \\\"it's going to be on the edge of Vera Rubin detection, and Vera Rubin may not find it.\\\"\\n\\nBut even if it doesn't spot Planet 9 directly, the Rubin Observatory might find some more minor planets, ones whose orbits might be affected by Planet 9. And that could provide additional evidence that such a giant planet really exists.\\n\\nUp until now, says Sheppard, astronomers haven't found enough small, far-off minor planets with orbits that can be analyzed for evidence of Planet 9's gravitational influence, so he thinks the existence of this planet is an open question.\\n\\n\\\"The statistics just aren't there to definitively say yes or no,\\\" he says.\\n\\nGetting serious\\n\\nBrown, meanwhile, says he is \\\"extraordinarily confident\\\" that Planet 9 is out there.\\n\\nOver the years he's tried to remain skeptical, he says, but was finally convinced by an obscure gravitational effect that he and some colleagues noticed and on about a year ago.\\n\\n\\\"If you talk to 20 different astronomers, you'll get 20 different takes on how confident they are,\\\" says Brown. \\\"But I just don't see a way that the solar system can exist the way it does without there being a Planet 9.\\\"\\n\\nAs this year progresses, he says, the Rubin observatory will start building up a baseline picture of the sky, and by the end of the year it should have started detecting changes and making that data available to the astronomy community.\\n\\nAt that point, says Brown, \\\"we can get serious about trying to find Planet 9.\\\"\\n\\nEven if they aren't able to actually see a new planet, he adds, the Rubin observatory should provide enough new data that it should become clear whether the tell-tale orbital patterns they've been seeing really hold up to scrutiny.\\n\\n\\\"I think that what Vera Rubin will definitively do,\\\" says Brown, \\\"is tell us whether we're crazy or not.\\\"\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 58.820976930506085,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:00:36 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.npr.org\",\n                \"title\": \"NPR\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"Latin America & Caribbean\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 51.38107670054716,\n            \"second_model_score\": 47.64705882352941,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Energy\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Astronomers are hoping to prove the existence of \\\"Planet 9,\\\" a hypothetical giant planet in the outer solar system.

Kennedy Jr. publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday.\\n\\n“We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,” Kennedy told the network’s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Jon LaPook.\\n\\n“The federal government’s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy said. “I always said during my campaign — and every part, every public statement I’ve made — I’m not gonna take people’s vaccines away from them. What I’m gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.”\\n\\nA measles outbreak spanning multiple states is nearing 600 cases, and experts say it might just be the beginning.\\n\\nAs of Tuesday, Texas has reported 505 cases associated with the outbreak, New Mexico has reported 56 cases, and Oklahoma has reported 10: eight confirmed and two probable.\\n\\nCases in Kansas, which the state health department says may also be linked to the outbreak, reached last week.\\n\\nThe outbreak began in rural Gaines County, Texas, where most of the cases are concentrated, but Tuesday’s update shows spread into 21 Texas counties. Local officials are particularly worried about spread of the measles virus into new areas and vulnerable populations, such as urban centers.\\n\\n“I’m worried about exposures in grocery stores, malls and those types of places that don’t exist as much out in the rural community,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said Tuesday. “You have a much bigger population, so one case can be exposing a lot more individuals.”\\n\\nIn these areas, public health workers will need to do more to figure out who is at risk, who is exposed and who needs to isolate, she said. Some local health departments have said that recent cuts to funding from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will hinder their epidemiology work and lab capacity for identifying measles cases.\\n\\nIn Lubbock, measles exposure in a day care center has resulted in seven cases in children under the age of 5, Wells said Tuesday. This is a particularly vulnerable community, as many of the children are not old enough to get their second dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.\\n\\nUnder normal circumstances, the CDC recommends one dose of MMR between 12 to 15 months of age and another between 4 and 6 years. In outbreak situations, these guidelines may be updated.\\n\\n“Our biggest challenge right now is really around younger children,” Wells said. “One of my biggest concerns was outbreaks in places where we have vulnerable individuals, individuals that can’t be vaccinated yet, or children that are undervaccinated because they’re only eligible for that one vaccine.”\\n\\nThe local health department is encouraging vaccination for other children at the day care center, in line with recommendations from the that children ages 1 to 4 in the outbreak area get their second dose as soon as possible, as long as it’s at least 28 days after their first dose.\\n\\nInfants who are 6 to 11 months in the outbreak area can get an early dose of the MMR vaccine and will then resume the normal MMR schedule with two more doses.\\n\\nGiven the contagious nature of the virus and low vaccination rates in many pockets of the country, experts expect the outbreak to grow, possibly for more than a year. Continued spread of the virus for more than 12 months could threaten the measles elimination status the US earned in 2000, according to the .\\n\\n“I think it is going to be something that really pushes us to the deadline for elimination for the United States, as well as for the Americas,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Tuesday.\\n\\nCompared with other recent US outbreaks, cases are vastly undercounted in this outbreak, he said, in part because it has been concentrated in a Mennonite population that is undervaccinated.\\n\\n“There might be reticence to get tested in some of those areas, [which] probably means that this is a lot bigger than the outbreaks that we’ve seen in the past,” Adalja said.\\n\\nThree deaths have been connected with the outbreak: two school-age children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico whose death remains under investigation. All of these people were unvaccinated.\\n\\nThere have been at least 659 measles cases this year, according to a CNN tally. Data from the CDC shows that there are usually cases of measles. The number of deaths in this outbreak has reaffirmed to experts that there are far more cases on the ground than have been reported.\\n\\nTraveling in the southwest on Tuesday, Kennedy touted the response to the outbreak.\\n\\n“Our strategy has been very successful. … The growth rate has diminished substantially,” he said. “And so what we’re doing right here in the United States is a model for the rest of the world.”\\n\\nBut experts say it’s not so simple.\\n\\n“I don’t think that RFK Jr. has the information to be able to say that. I don’t think any of us have full situational awareness of what’s going on with this outbreak. … We think cases are undercounted,” Adalja said. “You can’t say something is flattening if you don’t actually know the denominator of cases or [have] an understanding you’re getting [the] full capture of the cases.”\\n\\nThe outbreak will continue until the virus infects all susceptible people in the area, he said.\\n\\n“All of these cases could be avoided if everyone who had the ability to be vaccinated did so,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatric Care in Annapolis, Maryland. “Our overall vaccination rates are declining, which is an anti-science trend, so I’m not sure the United States is a model at all in this regard.”\\n\\nThe CDC updated its for health care providers across the country Tuesday, urging them to stay alert for possible cases. The agency noted that 12% of reported cases this year had been hospitalized and that the “measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.”\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -93.14552247524261,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 10:53:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.cnn.com\",\n                \"title\": \"CNN\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"Latin America & Caribbean\",\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -69.07276123762131,\n            \"second_model_score\": -45,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Health Care\",\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Amid a growing multi-state measles outbreak with nearly 600 cases, HHS Secretary Robert F.

You can listen to episodes .\\n\\nWhen people are young, if they are fortunate enough to enjoy good health, they get to move their bodies with carefree abandon — running, jumping, bending, dancing, twisting — in pursuit of whatever activity they are engaged in.\\n\\nBut if they are lucky enough to get older, life intervenes: Free time becomes more limited, and interests, responsibilities, habits and behavior all change. Many people abandon the playground and learn to sit — in a classroom, at the office, in front of the TV, in a car.\\n\\nThen at some point, many notice they have grown stiffer, and maybe it hurts to do this movement or that one, or they can no longer move in all the ways they want to. And people often attribute the aches and pains to simply getting older — but is the change inevitable?\\n\\n“The one thing that doesn’t have to change over the whole lifespan is your range of motion,” Dr. Kelly Starrett, a physical therapist and former professional athlete, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.\\n\\nQuantifying mobility has been, excuse the pun, a moving target. “Every physician on the planet, every physical therapist, every chiropractic physician, all agree about what the body should be able to do. We’ve said, here’s what blood pressure is, and everyone knows that. Here’s what (body) temperature is, and everyone knows that. We started to become very sophisticated about understanding some aspects of our physiology, but not range of motion,” Starrett said.\\n\\n“What ended up happening is we created this definition of (mobility): Do you have access to your native range of motion? Can you control it? And, when we improve those things, did what matters to you improve?” he asked.\\n\\nStarrett’s most recent book, coauthored with his wife, Juliet Starrett, is It addresses mobility: measuring it (with 10 tests) and, equally important, regaining it in small increments that don’t take up all your time.\\n\\n“How do we simplify the process so it doesn’t feel so overwhelming?” he asked. “I’m not giving a busy working mother another listicle.”\\n\\nYou can listen to the full episode .\\n\\nWhy should you care about range of motion and mobility when the couch is so comfy and many of your needs and wants are only a mouse click away? Because mobility is associated with longevity, Starrett said.\\n\\nHe noted that falling is a big predictor of in people age 65 and older.\\n\\n“If I don’t have access to balance or range of motion, I can’t solve as many movement problems. And losing your balance is a movement problem,” he said. “Getting up and down and being independent is a movement problem. Being able to rise from a chair while you’re holding your baby or your cat, or holding a cup of coffee and a book is just a movement problem.”\\n\\nAs you get older, your body is more likely to “throw an error,” Starrett said. It’s a matter of use it or lose it.\\n\\n“If I want to have a joint and tendons that act like joints and tendons my whole life, I better use that joint and I better load those tendons,” he said. “Otherwise, they’re not going to be available to me as readily.”\\n\\nMuscles and tissues are like obedient dogs, he said. “They always adapt. At no age do you stop healing. At no age do you lose the ability to reclaim range of motion. It’s going to be a little slower than when you were 15 — that’s true. But the bottom line is your body is always going to adapt.”\\n\\nWhat can you do to easily retain or regain some of your mobility? Starrett has five tips.\\n\\nGet your body into different shapes\\n\\nPeople mostly move from lying down to sitting in a chair to walking around a bit, Starrett noted. “Modern environments don’t really ask much of the movement language of our bodies. Most people are only using a few words that their bodies could write,” he said.\\n\\n“The first thing we should be thinking about is, ‘Well, how do I increase my exposure to more movement language?’” he said.\\n\\n“One of the easiest ways, for example, that we think would foundationally change society is if people sat on the ground in the evening, for 20 or 30 minutes while they were watching TV, while they’re reading a book,” he said. “And that could be leaning up against the couch; it doesn’t have to be in a strict lotus.”\\n\\nGetting into and out of that cross-legged position will also expose you to different movements, especially in the hips and knees. The practice can also tell you a bit about your ability to move freely and effortlessly.\\n\\n“Being able to get up and down from a cross-legged position is an excellent predictor of all-cause morbidity and all-cause mortality because … it says a lot about how you are interacting and adapting to your environment,” he said.\\n\\nAnd if you need to fidget, fidget — because that will also get your body into additional interesting positions, he said, such as kneeling or squatting.\\n\\nFor more ideas on getting your body into different shapes, you can watch short instructional videos on Starrett’s (workout of the day) YouTube channel.\\n\\nHang from a bar 3 minutes a day\\n\\nIf you’re experiencing aches and pains in your shoulders, neck or back, Starrett has a fix. “I want you to hang for three minutes a day,” he said.\\n\\nYou can hang in many different ways, he said — by grabbing the edge of a sink or a doorframe or, better yet, a pull-up bar — just get your arms above your head and stretch a bit. Even the yoga pose “downward-facing dog” counts as hang time, he added.\\n\\n“That would fundamentally change your posture, change your neck pain, change your breath, change your shoulders, make it so you’re more durable. I mean, that is a foundational posture,” he said.\\n\\n“Go to the airport and watch people in the (body) scanner,” he said. “You’ll see why we have that as a test (in the book), because people literally … cannot put their arms over their head anymore.”\\n\\nWalk more (for a surprising reason)\\n\\nTo keep stiffness at bay and maintain your mobility, Starrett advises everyone to do plenty of walking every day.\\n\\n“If I could give everyone in my family a pill that reduced all-cause mortality and morbidity by 51% — that’s walking 8,000 steps a day,” he said.\\n\\n“If you want your bones and tendons and ligaments and perceptive systems to work, you have to physically load them,” he said. “Right now, we’re seeing an epidemic of osteoporosis, osteopenia, sarcopenia — people are losing muscle, losing bone. That’s because this body is an adaptation machine, and if you stress it, it adapts, and if youdon’t stress it, it adapts (in an undesirable way).” Walking loads our bones, our connective tissue, our tendons and our musculature.\\n\\nAdditionally, walking helps the body decongest and clear waste, Starrett said.\\n\\n“Your body makes about 3 to 4 liters of lymphatic fluid every day,” he explained. “And the lymph system is the sewage system of the body: all of the broken-down cellular material, all of the waste, all the proteins that are too big to come in through your capillaries, all go out through your lymphatic system.\\n\\n“What we need to do is appreciate that that sewage system of the body has been bootstrapped through our muscle system,” he said. “And so, if we want to decongest, move the waste along, then we have to keep moving.”\\n\\nIt also happens that as congested tissues get stiff, they don’t heal as well, he said. By decongesting our tissues, we get improved blood flow, which is also good for the brain.\\n\\nPlay more\\n\\nExercise doesn’t need to be all work.\\n\\n“We started to treat the health of the body as like some onerous task,” said Starrett, noting that play has been lost in our modern lives. “When’s the last time you did a sport or jumped into a dance class?\\n\\n“One of my favorite tools that I use even for my elite athletes (are videos by) Caleb Marshall, who is ,” he said. “We use (his free three-minute dance routines) to warm up, to have fun, to laugh. And what it does is it gets me moving in a novel way. It gets me interacting with my friends. It’s super fun.”\\n\\nStarrett also carries around a flying disc in his backpack so wherever he and his wife go, they can have spontaneous play during a moment of free time.\\n\\n“Play could be a continuum,” he said. “Going for a walk with your friends in the evening — I’m going to call it play. Exploring your neighborhood on a hike could be play. Humans are best when we’re playing. And that will solve a lot of movement problems.”\\n\\nDon’t neglect the basics\\n\\nFor robust physical movement, Starrett advised a balanced diet with enough protein and fruits and vegetables.\\n\\nStarrett recommended aiming for a day. “That could be frozen, that could be fresh, that could be beans, that could be potatoes, that could be fruits and vegetables — not just kale,” he said. “It’s about fiber and micronutrients. I need you to have all the vitamins and minerals on board so that you can have healthy tissues.”\\n\\nAnd he recommends at minimum getting 0.7 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight. “It’s about, ‘Hey, I want to have enough protein on board to be able to build muscle and build bone.’”\\n\\nAnd don’t forget sleep.\\n\\n“You’ve got to sleep,” Starrett said. “There’s not a single study in the world that says you can get bywith less than seven hours of sleep. So, we look at seven as our sort of minimum threshold.”\\n\\n“When I work with people who are in chronic pain, who want to change their body composition, learn a skill, heal an injury, we start with their sleep,” he said.\\n\\nWe hope these five tips help you get started on your mobility journey.

The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up 1.90%\\n\\nAll of the Magnificent 7 stocks took it on the chin yesterday, but Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the biggest loser, falling 5%, followed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dropping 4.9% and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 2.6%.\\n\\nSo far, though, trading shows the tech stocks pretty much shrugging off the latest announcement with the entire group except Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) moving higher in early trading.\\n\\nWhile Apple is obviously closely tied to the China trade, its stock swung from being down to moving up 3.11% heading into the morning bell. Tesla is up 4%, Amazon is 2% higher, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is jumping 4%\\n\\nApple could have most to lose\\n\\nApple has been scrambling to shift manufacturing away from China as quickly as possible and The Wall Street Journal reported it would be as it could to India.\\n\\nWhile India is also getting hit with new tariffs from Trump, at 27%, they are far more manageable than the doubling of rates China just got hit with. The iPhone, which makes up half of Apple’s revenue, is primarily sourced from China and the rising trade tensions that suddenly opened up into a “hot war” with tariffs has seen AAPL stock plummet. Shares are down 31% year-to-date, but they’ve lost 22% of their value in just the last week.\\n\\nTrump said yesterday he thinks the iPhone can be because “we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources” to do so. But such shifts can’t happen overnight and in fact take several years. Also, it would raise the cost of an iPhone due to the higher labor costs.\\n\\nWith China also imposing new export restrictions on rare earth minerals, manufacturing the iPhone domestically could become more difficult. Rare earth minerals are only a small fraction of the iPhone, but they play critical roles in its speakers, Taptic Engine, and color display. Apple, though, has moved to use 100% recycled rare earth elements in its smartphone.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.99963045120239,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:55:57 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://247wallst.com\",\n                \"title\": \"24/7 Wall St.\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"South Asia\",\n                \"North America\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -64.9998152256012,\n            \"second_model_score\": -30.000000000000004,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\",\n                \"Industrials\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China are rattling markets.

In the paper, he identified seven fundamental variables (earnings, return on equity, return on assets, accrual operating profitability to equity, cash operating profitability to assets, gross profit to assets and net payout ratio) that he combined into a single fundamental momentum measure. He showed that stocks in the top 20% of the universe according to that measure outperformed the market going forward.

While sluggish sales, weak delivery figures, and mounting concerns about a global economic slowdown have weighed heavily on the stock, those issues may not tell the whole story.\\n\\nThe real drag could be the growing backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Once hailed as a trailblazer, Musk is now drawing fire from all sides – not just for the increasingly political tone of his public activity, but also for what critics say is a wandering focus away from the businesses he’s supposed to be running.\\n\\nIt’s not the first time Musk’s outside ventures have shaken investor confidence. During his chaotic bid for Twitter (now X) in late 2022, Tesla shares lost roughly 30% — only to rebound in 2023 once Musk seemed to refocus on the core business.\\n\\nOne investor, known by the pseudonym Lily Investment Research, believes history is about to repeat itself – with big gains ahead for Tesla shares.\\n\\n“Tesla looks well-positioned for a 2023 style recovery where it rose from the ashes following the ‘Twitter spiral,’” asserts the investor.\\n\\nLily notes that there have been plenty of indications that Musk will be leaving his DOGE role in the Trump administration. This would free him up to rededicate himself to driving Tesla’s growth catalysts, of which there seem to be plenty, according to the investor.\\n\\nAmong others, Lily mentions the ramp-up of the upgraded Model Y and the planned commercial launch of the company’s robotaxi service in June.\\n\\nThe investor notes that Tesla can be quite sensitive to “headline shocks,” and the on-time roll-out of the company’s robotaxi technology a few months hence would send a strong indication that TSLA is back on track.\\n\\nMoreover, Lily is convinced that the depressed share price has already taken into account the worst-case scenarios for the company, leaving plenty of upside ahead once Musk leaves his governmental post and refocuses his energies.\\n\\n“With Musk’s DOGE responsibilities nearing an end, Tesla stock’s turnaround should be right around the corner,” concludes Lily, who rates TSLA a Buy.

The Street remains split, with 16 Buys, 11 Holds, and 11 Sells — making TSLA a consensus Hold. Still, analysts see potential upside: the average 12-month price target sits at $307.75, implying a 30% gain from current levels.

Last night, a Tesla Supercharger cabinet exploded in Lacey, Washington, and authorities are suspecting it may have been caused by a bomb. The FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and local police are investigating the “malicious mischief.” The Supercharger station is currently shut down because the station that powers the stalls was severely damaged and is also missing a part.\\n\\nFollowing the ill-fated incident, Tesla commented on social media platform X about the situation, and requested the public to not “mess with critical infrastructure.” The suspected bombing is the latest in a series of attacks on Tesla, with the company’s stores, charging networks, and customer vehicles being damaged as a sign of protest against CEO Elon Musk. The billionaire’s close ties with President Trump and his role as head of the DOGE Committee have infuriated consumers both in the U.S. and abroad. The President, himself, has labeled such attacks as “domestic terrorism” and vowed to punish the offenders.\\n\\nTSLA Stock Is Hammered by Analysts’ Mixed Reviews\\n\\nWhile Tesla’s stores and charging networks are being literally bombed, TSLA stock is being hammered by mixed analyst reviews due to slumping auto sales and its tarnished brand image.\\n\\nYesterday, GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson reiterated a “Sell” rating on TSLA stock following the update on China EV registrations for the week of March 31 to April 6. According to the data, Tesla’s Chinese auto registrations plummeted by a massive 83% week-over-week, marking its largest drop in the key Chinese market. Given the significant decline, Johnson stated that “things appear to be worsening” for Tesla in its largest EV market.\\n\\nAt the same time, DBS analyst Elizabelle Pang cut the price target on TSLA stock from $300 to $275 (24% upside potential), while keeping a “Hold” rating. Pang cited several factors for the lowered price target and hold rating on Tesla. One of the most important reasons is that Tesla missed its Q1 delivery estimates by 11%, raising doubts on its future potential and leading to downward revisions in delivery expectations. Additionally, Tesla is losing ground in the Chinese EV market to domestic rival BYD (BYDDF), and concerns over the looming Chinese tariffs continue to dampen investor optimism.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas remains optimistic about Tesla’s future potential, which he believes will be driven largely by humanoid robots, autonomous driving, and other advanced systems. Jonas maintained his “Buy” rating on TSLA stock with a price target of $410, implying an impressive 84.8% upside potential. Overall, Jonas’ optimism stems from the belief that “the challenges facing Tesla’s current business are widely reported and well known, while the opportunities in the future business are potentially greatly underestimated.”\\n\\nIs Tesla Stock a Good Buy Now?\\n\\nOverall, TSLA stock has a Hold consensus rating on TipRanks, based on 16 Buys, 11 Holds, and 11 Sell ratings. Also, the average Tesla price target of $312.21 implies 40.7% upside potential from current levels.

Earlier this month, the American electric vehicle (EV) giant reported 336,681 cars delivered in Q1 2025, representing a 13% year-over-year decline from Q1 2024. The figure missed analyst expectations of 370,000 vehicles and prompted a and express concerns over “unprecedented brand damage.”\\n\\nStay Ahead of the Market:\\n\\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with\\n\\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using\\n\\nAs a result, I am bearish on TSLA and believe its stock will continue to underperform due to declines and non-core growth challenges.\\n\\nThe Musk Effect: When a CEO Becomes the Brand\\n\\nFollowing Elon Musk’s involvement in President Donald Trump’s campaign and administration, public perception of the enigmatic futurist has soured across the U.S. A recent poll showed that 36% of respondents have a “very unfavorable” opinion of him. Analysts agree that .\\n\\nUnlike Tesla, most consumers are unaware of who runs the company that manufactures their vehicle. Musk’s quirky persona and public visibility are a double-edged sword. People have been conditioned to think of Musk when they think of Tesla. Musk, in effect, is the Tesla brand, and now, many Americans wouldn’t dare purchase a Tesla because of Musk.\\n\\nRising Competition Erodes Tesla’s Market Position\\n\\nTesla’s problems did not begin (and will not end) with Elon Musk and his public image. Competition in the EV market is strengthening, with Tesla losing its leadership position in international markets like China. Aside from the political theatrics, the company’s bread-and-butter car production business is fading.\\n\\nFor instance, Chinese automaker BYD has now overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, thanks to outperformance in China. Tesla is also losing ground in European markets. In the E.U., data revealed Tesla’s new vehicle registrations dropped 40% year-over-year in February. Much of this can be attributed to Tesla’s hesitance, or inability, to manufacture an entry-level EV. BYD’s Dolphin Honor EV “Free” trim, for example, costs just $15,700 and offers a range of 261 miles–an offering that Tesla struggles to match with its $30,000+ offerings with a similar range.\\n\\nPerhaps most concerning is Tesla’s diminishing technological edge. While Tesla pioneered the modern EV, its competitors have caught up. For instance, Hyundai’s Ioniq 6 boosts an EPA-rated range of 361 miles and costs only $43,600. Tesla’s luxury appeal has diminished as well, and competitors like Mercedes, BMW, and Lucid (LCID) now match or exceed its premium offerings in range, charging speed, and interior quality.\\n\\nLastly, legacy automakers like Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) have aggressively expanded their EV lineups with models like the F-150 Lightning and Cadillac Lyriq. Both companies have loyal customers and extensive dealer networks. So, if any of their customers are tempted by an American EV, Tesla is no longer the leading option.\\n\\nPremium Price and Slowing Growth Raise Valuation Concerns\\n\\nThen there’s Tesla’s premium valuation. Tesla’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 117.5, implying sky-high growth expectations. Meanwhile, Tesla’s peers, like Toyota Motor (TM), trade at a P/E of 6.3. Moreover, Tesla’s high P/E is inconsistent with its growth. In 2024, revenues grew just 2% year-over-year.\\n\\nTo be fair, Tesla is not your average car company. Its autonomous driving technology, revenues from software services like “premium connectivity,” and diverse product offerings warrant a higher valuation than its strictly automotive peers. The question is, to what extent and for how long? In my view, any outperformance will be short-lived and brief.\\n\\nAmbitious But Unproven Future Horizons\\n\\nTesla’s vision for the future appears from a sci-fi novel: completely autonomous cars and humanoid robots. , Musk estimated that Tesla’s humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate “over $10 trillion in revenue long-term.” Musk plans to build thousands of humanoid robots this year.\\n\\nRemember that Musk is no stranger to lofty goals. In 2019, Musk was “very confident” that one million Tesla robotaxis would fill the streets by 2020. It’s safe to say that Tesla’s ambitions for Optimus should also be taken with a grain of salt. Tesla’s full self-driving (FSD) capability remains in beta testing with no clear timeline for regulatory approval.\\n\\nTesla’s energy storage business grew 67% despite these challenges in 2024. Its Megapack product line could eventually provide a meaningful revenue stream independent of vehicle sales. Still, Tesla’s energy storage business pales in comparison to its automotive segment.\\n\\nIs Tesla a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\\n\\nOn Wall Street, TSLA stock has a consensus rating of Hold based on 16 Buy, 11 Hold, and 11 Sell ratings over the past three months. implies ~30% upside potential over the next twelve months. Moreover, Tesla stock is rated as of 1.\\n\\nOn Monday, on TSLA from $550 to $315 per share, citing concerns that tariffs may accelerate the trend of Chinese consumers choosing domestic EV companies like BYD. Notably, over 20% of Tesla’s revenues are from China.\\n\\nChallenges Outweigh Opportunities\\n\\nTesla’s road ahead is challenging. Its EV market leadership showed signs of weakness even before its CEO decided to dive into political skullduggery.

The investment firm argues that the market overreacted with the decline, suggesting that Tesla’s long-term growth prospects remain strong. With this, Benchmark analyst Michael Legg reaffirmed his Buy rating on TSLA stock. Although Legg lowered his price target from $475 to $350 due to negative market sentiment following tariff announcements, the upside potential remains strong at 58% from current levels.\\n\\nBenchmark Calls Recent Selloff Overstated\\n\\nTesla’s stock has dropped sharply from its post-election high above $480, now hovering in the low $200s. Year-to-date, TSLA stock has declined by 45%. Legg sees this dip as a buying opportunity. He argues that the recent decline in stock price and sales is overstated, given the short-term challenges and the upcoming growth prospects.\\n\\nAdditionally, Legg views the expected release of a new vehicle in the second quarter as a potential catalyst to drive up Tesla’s deliveries. Legg also pointed out that Tesla is less affected by new U.S. auto tariffs due to its North American production being mainly in California and Texas, giving it an advantage over other automakers.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Benchmark pointed out several risks, such as political pressure, an aging product lineup, and growing global competition. However, it believes that challenges like political backlash may ease as the year progresses.\\n\\nBenchmark Pins Hope on Autonomy and Robotics\\n\\nLooking ahead, Benchmark stated that Tesla’s overall potential extends far beyond vehicles, which is a key factor in their positive outlook. It highlights Tesla’s ambitious plans for the Optimus robotics platform as a major growth driver, allowing the company to transition from a vehicle maker to a broader automation provider.\\n\\nIn the near term, Legg is excited about the launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, set for June. While the service will begin on a smaller scale, he’s closely monitoring its expansion into other areas.\\n\\nWhat Is the 12-Month Price Target for Tesla Stock?\\n\\nOn Wall Street, analysts have maintained a neutral stance on Tesla stock.

Between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31, 2024, Tesla's share price return was less than 1%. But following President Donald Trump's election victory on Nov. 5, Tesla stock kicked into another gear entirely -- rocketing more than 60% through December.\\n\\nTesla CEO Elon Musk's close ties to the Trump administration were initially seen as a coveted asset -- one that would pave the way for Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions thanks to a . Unfortunately, the bullish narrative has reversed course and Tesla stock is now in a free fall of epic proportions. As of 12:20 p.m. ET on April 7, shares of Tesla were down by 44% on the year -- making it the worst-performing member of the \\\".\\\"\\n\\nLet's explore what is driving Tesla stock lower. More importantly, I'll detail what things investors should be keeping an eye on as the company's first-quarter earnings report looms on April 22.\\n\\nTesla investors have endured a rough start to 2025\\n\\nIn a true moment of irony, Musk's alignment with the Trump administration has gone from being seen as a positive to a stark negative over the last few months. As a reminder, Musk is not just a surrogate for the president -- he's a \\\"special government employee\\\" now. After Trump won in November, he tapped Musk to lead the waste-cutting initiative called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\\n\\nOver the last few months, Musk's efforts at DOGE have been polarizing among political activists. The result so far has been extreme damage to the Tesla brand, causing some investors to fear what demand for the company's vehicles could look like.\\n\\nAnd speaking of demand trends, just take a look at the post below from Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. For what it's worth, Ives is a longtime Tesla bull and often expresses support for Musk's leadership on social media. Even so, the sentiment expressed in the post makes clear that one of the most optimistic Tesla analysts on Wall Street is starting to get concerned.\\n\\nThe storm could just be getting started\\n\\nTesla is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings following market close on April 22. While the poor delivery and production stats referenced above serve as a proxy for the tone of the report, it's hard to know with any accuracy just how poor the financial picture will be.\\n\\nWhile it's entirely possible that the ongoing selling in Tesla stock right now is overdone, I have some trepidation over the upcoming earnings call and fear the stock could be headed much lower.\\n\\nIs Tesla stock a buy before April 22?\\n\\nThis is not the first time that Tesla has faced a public relations crisis. And historically speaking, one thing that Musk has typically been great at is marketing. What I mean by this is that during past periods of uncertainty or turbulence at Tesla, Musk found ways to pump up investors.\\n\\nIn fact, he did this during the last Tesla earnings call back in January. Even though 2024 was not the best year for Tesla as a business, the stock still soared. In addition to the surge following Trump's reelection, Musk was able to distract investors from waning demand in the car business by talking at length about the company's pursuits in artificial intelligence (AI) -- namely the Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot.\\n\\nWhile these endeavors are exciting, they are both part of the long-term thesis surrounding Tesla. My hope for the call later this month is for Musk to tame the souring investor sentiment by revealing an actual plan for what the company is going to do to rejuvenate the core electric vehicle business.\\n\\nWhile I usually do not encourage timing your buying and selling, this is no ordinary time for Tesla. In my eyes, this particular earnings call is pivotal. I think the prudent idea is to see how Musk handles questions from analysts and listen closely to his rhetoric. Will he address the strategic issues at the company right now, or try to deflect by talking more about AI and the future?\\n\\nI'd usually see now as a tempting opportunity to buy the dip, but I think the best strategy is to wait until after April 22 to potentially buy more Tesla stock depending on how the call goes.\\n\\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\\n\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The stock’s bounce came despite the S&P 500 and Dow both falling—making the rally even more unusual given how tightly Tesla has traded with the broader market since tariffs kicked in. But what really lit up investor chatter was the spat behind the scenes.\\n\\nMusk Clashes With White House Trade Voice\\n\\nNavarro, one of the architects of Trump’s aggressive tariff policy, appeared on CNBC this week and took a jab at Tesla’s global supply chain. He claimed Musk is “not a car manufacturer, he’s a car assembler,” pointing to Tesla’s international parts sourcing—something Navarro wants to curb under the administration’s America First strategy.\\n\\nMusk fired back fast. In a sharp post on X, he said, “Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false.” Musk also defended Tesla’s domestic footprint, pointing out that roughly 65% of the company’s components are U.S.- or Canada-sourced—enough to keep it ranked among the most American-made vehicles, according to Cars.com.\\n\\nTariff Turmoil Tests Tesla’s Staying Power\\n\\nTuesday’s wild price action reflected more than just social media drama. Tesla shares swung from $250.44 to $217.80, a nearly 13% intraday spread, before settling at $221.86—down 4.9% on the day. Since Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2, Tesla stock has dropped more than 21%. Investors are rattled by the potential cost hikes and global supply chain snarls that could hit Tesla harder than legacy automakers.\\n\\nMusk isn’t staying quiet. He said over the weekend that the U.S. and Europe “should not impose any tariffs on each other,” aligning himself with globalist manufacturing interests rather than Washington’s protectionist turn.\\n\\nBoth Musk and Navarro have the president’s ear, which means this feud could have real consequences. Navarro advises on trade. Musk co-leads DOGE, the group tasked with government efficiency. Their disagreement—especially in public—is a reminder of how unpredictable this tariff cycle could get for Tesla shareholders.\\n\\nIs Tesla a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\\n\\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on TSLA stock based on 16 Buys, 11 Holds, and 11 Sells assigned in the past three months.

Amazon (AMZN+0.12%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.22%), and Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%) were also in the red. The renewed tariff war and surging yields have weighed heavily on growth names, reversing much of the sector’s 2025 momentum.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBond yields also surged, with the 30-year Treasury topping 4.75% — its highest since mid-February. “If Trump’s secret agenda is to crash the stock market to bring down long-term interest rates, the plan already failed,” economist Peter Schiff wrote on X. “The plan to crash the stock market is now crashing the bond market too.”\\n\\nDelta Air Lines plans to reduce capacity\\n\\nDelta kicked off the day with better-than-expected earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $0.46 versus the $0.38 expected by Wall Street. Adjusted revenue came in at $12.98 billion, matching forecasts, while net income jumped to $240 million, up from $37 million a year earlier. Shares rose more than 2% in premarket trading.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut while the headline numbers suggest resilience, Delta also said it plans to reduce flight capacity in the second quarter, signaling caution amid rising costs and shifting travel patterns. The airline cited the need to “restore operational reliability” and more tightly manage fuel and labor expenses.\\n\\nCracking a Corona — or cutting back? Constellation knows\\n\\nConstellation, the beverage giant behind Corona, Modelo, Kim Crawford, and Robert Mondavi, will report after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS of $2.27 on $2.12 billion in revenue. Watch for commentary on U.S. beer and wine sales — consumer staples that often shift in tone during periods of economic stress. Results could offer clues about household confidence as inflation lingers and real wages cool.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShifting retail signals from Walmart and Big Lots\\n\\nEarly Wednesday, Walmart said it was pulling its Q1 guidance due to uncertainty surrounding newly imposed Trump tariffs on Chinese goods, particularly electric vehicles and consumer electronics. The move underscores how trade policy is clouding visibility for even the most dominant U.S. retailers.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMeanwhile, Big Lots (BIG) also reports earnings today, though its place on the OTC market is a reminder of how far it’s fallen.

The dean’s dismissal, combined with past administrative and other changes, has caused disruption and growing concern about how shared governance has been implemented at the university. These concerns have raised important questions about how decisions are made, how voices are included and how we live out our core values in practice.\\n\\nImportantly, the Faculty Senate’s no-confidence resolution urges the board “to act immediately to engage with the faculty and other constituent groups on campus to collaboratively develop corrective actions to re-establish an atmosphere of mutual respect, with the goal of rebuilding trust and a willingness to work together, and to ensure a more transparent and inclusive decision-making process guided by the University of Wyoming’s principles and regulations regarding shared governance.”\\n\\nThat is what we intend to do. We thank the Faculty Senate for its hard work and thoughtful input.\\n\\nThe board takes these matters seriously. A strong, transparent and inclusive approach to governance is essential -- not just for the health of the university, but for the trust placed in us by the people of Wyoming and by the thousands of alumni who continue to support and champion this institution.\\n\\nIn response, the board has directed President Seidel and Interim Provost Scott Turpen to lead a thorough and inclusive review of how shared governance is currently being operationalized across the university. We expect this process to include meaningful dialogue about what is working, what must be improved and how we can strengthen the relationships and trust that must exist to achieve our mission.\\n\\nSeparate from this commitment, the trustees took an action -- one that we stand behind -- in removing the dean of the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences. Due to the concerns and questions that have arisen on campus and beyond, we feel compelled to provide more detail on the difficult decision to remove the dean.The president had recommended to not renew the dean’s contract and allow it to expire in 2026, but the Board of Trustees decided to remove the dean now based upon observations and interactions during our March meeting, when the dean was unable to articulate a vision for meeting the goals of the Tier-1 Engineering Initiative after several years of opportunity to advance the college to meet those goals.\\n\\nWe reiterate that the decision to remove the dean was based solely on his performance -- not on the dean’s objections to a possible, relatively minor proposed funding shift designed from the outset to protect the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences’ interests and compliance with the Tier-1 goals as the planned transition of the School of Computing into a stand-alone unit was effectuated.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging the Faculty Senate’s no-confidence resolution, we unanimously affirm our support for both President Seidel and our commitment to shared governance of the university.''\\n\\nSeidel has served as President of the University of Wyoming since 2020.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -3.3267706632614136,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:25:05 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://kgab.com\",\n                \"title\": \"KGAB\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -4.163385331630707,\n            \"second_model_score\": -4.999999999999999,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n            \"summary\": \"Following a faculty no-confidence vote against University of Wyoming President Seidel (43-11), the Board of Trustees issued a statement supporting Seidel and reaffirming their commitment to shared governance.

With AMD’s considerable exposure to Chinese markets and reliance on third-party manufacturing, mainly through Taiwan Semiconductor , the market remains concerned about the potential impact of tariffs on the company.\\n\\nTariffs Threaten Semiconductor Supply Chains\\n\\nAt the center of this decline is a policy shift from President Donald Trump’s administration. Last week, Trump introduced , targeting a long list of U.S. trading partners. While semiconductors are exempted, the relief may only be temporary.\\n\\nAdding to the pressure, tariffs were levied on wafer fabrication equipment imported into the U.S. While AMD relies on Taiwan Semiconductor for manufacturing, the ripple effect of these tariffs could still impact its bottom line.\\n\\nAMD is at a disadvantage compared to its larger rival, Nvidia . Unlike Nvidia, which reported an adjusted gross margin of , AMD’s margin . This significant margin gap provides a thinner cushion to AMD and limits its ability to absorb cost increases without eating into profits.\\n\\nAMD’s China Exposure Presents a Major Risk\\n\\nFurther, China's role in AMD’s business is important. AMD reported revenue of $6.23 billion from China (including Hong Kong) in 2024, about 24.2% of its total sales. Thus, a retaliatory tariff from China on American technology products would make AMD’s chips more expensive for Chinese buyers, potentially hampering its competitiveness in one of its most important markets.\\n\\nWall Street has begun recalibrating expectations. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh recently from “Buy” to “Hold,” citing uncertainty around its business in China and concerns over margin sustainability. This has deepened investor skepticism, especially with AMD lagging behind Nvidia in several key performance metrics.\\n\\nAMD’s Growth Drivers Still Intact\\n\\nYet, it’s not all doom and gloom. AMD’s core business remains strong, and the company continues to show impressive growth in areas critical to its long-term strategy, particularly in data centers and AI. In 2024, AMD reported from its data center segment, marking a 94% year-over-year increase. This was primarily driven by surging demand for its Instinct MI300X GPUs.\\n\\nThe company is also moving aggressively to cement its place in the AI ecosystem. Its marks a strategic move to enhance its in-house AI development capabilities. With this acquisition, AMD aims to deliver high-performance AI models optimized for its hardware architecture.\\n\\nOn the product side, AMD is rolling out an ambitious lineup. The MI325X GPUs are , and the company is already laying the groundwork for its next-generation MI350 series. These GPUs are expected to deliver significant performance and energy efficiency. Looking further, AMD has its eyes set on the MI400 series. It's also investing heavily in ROCm, its open software platform.\\n\\nAMD Stock’s Valuation\\n\\nWhile analysts have a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating on AMD stock, the recent price drop may represent a value opportunity for long-term investors. With a forward , AMD appears attractively priced, especially given its double-digit earnings growth potential.\\n\\nFor instance, analysts expect AMD to post in 2025, up 47.7% year-over-year. AMD’s bottom line is projected to increase 36.2% in FY26.\\n\\nHowever, AMD’s valuation becomes less compelling when compared to Nvidia, which trades at a slightly higher but commands superior margins, has a leading market share in the AI space, and is well-placed to navigate macroeconomic shocks.\\n\\nConclusion: Bargain or Value Trap?\\n\\nUltimately, while AMD’s stock has become cheaper and its long-term potential remains intact, its short-term outlook remains clouded by geopolitical risks and competitive pressures. Thus, investors looking for a stock in the semiconductor space may find Nvidia to be a more appealing option.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The world's largest chip producer already controls two-thirds of the foundry market, according to TrendForce. Moreover, with (AI) demand growing at a rapid clip, the need for the chips it produces only continues to rise.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the healthy state of TSMC's business did not prevent a 35% drop in the stock price since January. However, with industry leadership and a diverse and desired client base, the short-term forces hammering TSMC stock are more likely a buying opportunity than a sign of a longer-term decline, and here's why.\\n\\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now.\\n\\nThe state of TSMC\\n\\nOther than TSMC's equipment maker ASML, few other AI stocks are in a stronger position. As the world's most advanced chipmaker, its clients are top chip design companies, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and Apple.\\n\\nThis market strength has unfortunately not stopped TSMC stock from falling. Geopolitical tensions with neighboring China are on the rise, and some investors fear for the future of the company should China invade the island. Also, investors fear the effect of tariffs on the company despite the Trump administration exempting semiconductors.\\n\\nNonetheless, TSMC seems to only extend its dominance, which makes its stock attractive with its lower price. TSMC's foundry market share grew more than 2 percentage points to 67% between the third and fourth quarters of 2024.\\n\\nAccording to multiple reports, TSMC has also entered into a joint venture with Intel, the largest chip manufacturer in the U.S. This agreement could potentially offer tremendous benefits to both companies. With the move, TSMC diversifies its manufacturing base away from the geopolitical risks it faces in Taiwan. Additionally, manufacturing in the U.S. blunts the effects of possible U.S. tariffs and pacifies Intel, which had begun to emerge as a potential competitor.\\n\\nFinancials remain strong\\n\\nDespite the recent drop in the stock price, TSMC's financial performance should make it more attractive to buyers over the long term. In 2024, revenue of $90 billion rose by 34% from year-ago levels. With that increase, gross margin rose by 2 percentage points to 56%, a testament to the company's rising efficiency.\\n\\nAdditionally, operating expenses dropped slightly as a percentage of revenue. That led to a comprehensive income of more than $39 billion, a 50% increase from year-ago levels.\\n\\nStill, staying on top of demand and increasing its market share requires the company to invest heavily in building and maintaining foundries. Thus, it spent almost $30 billion in 2024 on property and equipment, just slightly less than it spent in 2023. Between rising demand for the most advanced semiconductors and the push to build more foundries in the U.S., investors should expect that level of spending to continue.\\n\\nHowever, investors may find it easier to overlook those high fixed costs amid a lower valuation. TSMC's had exceeded 30 as recently as January. Today, its earnings multiple has fallen to just 21, and the of 16 indicates its rapid profit growth is likely to continue.\\n\\nConsider TSMC stock\\n\\nTSMC has become the dominant company in semiconductor manufacturing, and the deep discount in the stock price amid the stock sell-off makes it an even better buy.\\n\\nInvesting in TSMC does bring some degree of geopolitical risk, particularly with rising trade tensions. Nonetheless, virtually all top chip companies turn to TSMC to meet their manufacturing needs. Additionally, its new partnership with Intel addresses some of the geopolitical risks while turning a potential competitor into a partner.\\n\\nConsidering that investors can now buy this at a heavily discounted valuation, it has become an opportune time to buy shares.\\n\\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\\n\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\\n\\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late.

This news comes at a time of significant market volatility, driven in part by concerns over potential global tariffs, which have seen Intel’s stock price pull back sharply to around $19.30 in early April.\\n\\nThe buzz surrounding a strategic tie-up with TSMC presents a potentially transformative catalyst for Intel, prompting investors to consider whether current market fears are overshadowing a fundamental development that could reshape the company’s future.\\n\\nBuilding Blocks: Progress Paves the Way for Strategic Moves\\n\\nThe potential partnership with TSMC is not entirely unexpected, especially given Intel’s recent progress under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm on March 18. Tan, a respected figure in the semiconductor industry, has instilled a renewed sense of investor confidence. Additionally, Intel has recently begun risk production for its 18A process node, indicating that its advanced manufacturing technology is nearing commercialization. This progress suggests that Intel was already taking steps to improve its position before the partnership rumors surfaced, making it a more attractive collaborator for TSMC.\\n\\nThe Proposed Alliance: A Potential Turning Point\\n\\nRecent reports indicate that Intel and TSMC have explored a preliminary agreement to form a joint venture that would operate Intel’s semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the United States. Under this unconfirmed proposal, TSMC would acquire a significant minority stake—reportedly around 20%—in the new entity. This potential alliance is reportedly encouraged by U.S. government officials who aim to strengthen the domestic supply chain for advanced semiconductors.\\n\\nA partnership with TSMC could provide Intel with access to the world’s leading operational expertise in high-volume, cutting-edge chip production. This collaboration would significantly accelerate improvements in Intel Foundry Services (IFS), enhancing manufacturing yields, operational efficiencies, and overall service quality. Furthermore, housing critical TSMC-backed operations on U.S. soil would align with geopolitical goals to diversify semiconductor production away from East Asia, potentially unlocking further government incentives.\\n\\nBuy Signal Flashing? Why Intel Looks Attractive After the Pullback\\n\\nDespite the recent decline in Intel’s stock price, which has dropped to its 52-week low of $18.51, analysts see potential for recovery. The stock’s valuation metrics have been compressed, with a price-to-sales ratio of 1.56 and a price-to-book ratio of 0.79, indicating that the stock is trading below the stated value of its assets. This often signals market pessimism and potential undervaluation.\\n\\nCurrently, Intel has received a consensus rating of “Reduce” from analysts, but the average price target stands at $25.58, suggesting a potential upside of approximately 34% from current levels. This discrepancy between the current price and the potential value may present an opportunity for investors focused on fundamentals and strategic catalysts.\\n\\nA Defining Moment for Investors\\n\\nIntel is navigating a critical juncture in its history. While external market fears have weighed heavily on the stock, the company’s operational progress and strategic ambitions suggest a different narrative is unfolding beneath the surface. Key updates are expected in the upcoming Q1 earnings report on April 24 and the Foundry Direct Connect event on April 29, which will provide investors with clearer insights into whether Intel’s turnaround efforts are gaining real traction.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the potential partnership with TSMC could be a game changer for Intel, offering the company a path to regain its competitive edge in the semiconductor industry. As the market continues to react to external pressures, investors should keep a close eye on Intel’s developments, as they may signal a significant shift in the company’s trajectory.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 58.82351538714241,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:10:00 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.apnakal.com\",\n                \"title\": \"apnakal.com\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 45.49999298768885,\n            \"second_model_score\": 35.882352941176464,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Industrials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Rumors of a potential Intel and TSMC partnership are swirling, with TSMC potentially acquiring a 20% stake in Intel's US manufacturing facilities.

The extreme volatility has made every trade feel unpredictable, with positive and negative news about global equities swinging wildly in both directions. But amid all this chaos, Apple’s (AAPL) stock has erased its gains from the past twelve months. That’s pretty unusual for a stock of Apple’s size and stability.\\n\\nNo other company seems to be more in the crosshairs of this tariff storm than Cupertino’s finest. Only about 5% of Apple’s major suppliers are based in the U.S., which leaves it heavily reliant on overseas production and imports. With tariffs pushing up production costs almost overnight, some of Apple’s core products could see prices double. This is a massive, unprecedented challenge that no analyst could have predicted at this scale.\\n\\nGiven the chaotic situation in the U.S. tech sector, Apple is facing serious structural headwinds. For me, this doesn’t feel like an overreaction, even though the stock is down nearly 30% this year. With the current state of tariffs, I’m rating Apple as a Sell. The long-term outlook is uncertain depending on how the tariffs are resolved, and there’s a real chance the stock could drop even more.\\n\\nTariff Storm Puts AAPL at Greatest Risk\\n\\nWhile trade tariffs can bring more revenue into government coffers over time, they also destroy economic value by reducing trade volumes, especially in the short to medium term. Raising costs for foreign suppliers to do business with the U.S. might “encourage” them to set up factories in the U.S. But this pressure on suppliers doesn’t automatically lead to that outcome—it depends on a range of factors.\\n\\nNow, let’s consider Apple in this context. The company has 36% of its supplier facilities in Southeast Asia and India, 33% in Mainland China, 10% in Taiwan, 9% in Japan, 5% in Europe and the U.S., and just 1% in Latin America. In other words, 95% of Apple’s product manufacturing occurs overseas. Currently, a third of Apple’s suppliers are subject to a massive 104% tariff on goods from Mainland China, not to mention the additional tariffs imposed on production in every other country where Apple has manufacturing facilities.\\n\\nSpeaking of China, let’s rewind to between 2018 and 2019 when the U.S.-China trade war was in full swing under the Trump administration. At that time, Apple was trying to find ways to reduce its reliance on China, where nearly half of its biggest suppliers were based. Fast-forward more than five years, and 33% of Apple’s suppliers are still in Mainland China.\\n\\nIn short, this shows how complex and time-consuming it is—even for a company as large and influential as Apple—to reshape its supply chain. The big question is whether Apple can soften the tariff impact without hiking prices on its flagship products like the iPhone, Mac and AirPods. For now, the near-term future for Apple’s sales is bleak.\\n\\nEven Apple’s Strongest Bulls Are Concerned\\n\\nIn my opinion, Apple cannot dodge the tariff bullet without taking a major hit to its business. Apple’s supply chain is one of the most complex in the world, and the company’s ability to distribute its suppliers globally is the only reason it can offer an iPhone 16 for $799.\\n\\nNow, imagine Apple trying to shift its most prominent suppliers to the U.S. First, there are some huge problems. The biggest one is that unemployment in the U.S. is very low at 4.2%, which means the country would need a complete overhaul of its labor market to accommodate this shift. The second issue is that, unlike countries like Mexico and India, where manufacturing workers earn around $6,500 and $4,000 a year, the average wage in the U.S. is around $40,000.\\n\\nEven Dan Ives, a long-time Apple bull at Wedbush, is concerned. Although he maintains a positive outlook, he lowered his price target from $325 to $250. Ives believes that if Apple were to manufacture in the U.S., iPhones could cost as much as $3,500.\\n\\nConsidering that iPhones are the core of Apple’s ecosystem, such a drastic price increase would severely impact iPhone sales and the company’s high-margin Services business, which has been a significant growth driver in recent years.\\n\\nConsidering Different Scenarios for Apple\\n\\nTo better understand the trade war’s potential impact on Apple’s business, let’s consider a hypothetical scenario where China negotiates to ease the impact of the export tariffs. Suppose China backs down and agrees that iPhones can be manufactured in the U.S. under the same terms. However, would China then ban using iPhones and other Apple products within the country? The answer is, quite possibly.\\n\\nIf that were the case, it could lead to a significant loss for Apple. On average, around 30 million to 35 million iPhones are shipped to China annually, each selling for approximately $1,000. That’s about $35 billion in potential lost sales for Apple in the region. In fact, in FY 2024, Greater China accounted for $67 billion in sales, making up 17% of Apple’s total revenue for the year. This figure could decline substantially in the coming years.\\n\\nOn a more optimistic note, as , there’s some hope for Apple in the way consumers buy iPhones. Most people around the world still purchase their iPhones on installment plans. So, while a 15% to 20% price increase would likely hurt demand, the silver lining is that Apple may be somewhat insulated from these challenges. With installment plans, consumers can spread out the price hikes over two or three years, making the higher costs more digestible.\\n\\nIs Apple a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\\n\\nDespite the tariff debacle, several analysts have lowered their price targets on Apple stock, but only one has downgraded Apple to a Sell since the beginning of April. Out of the 33 analysts covering the stock in the past three months, 17 have a Buy rating, 12 rate the stock as Hold, and four have a Sell rating. The average price target is $242.61, which suggests a 36% upside potential from the current price.\\n\\nPatience is a Virtue With AAPL Stock\\n\\nFor long-term Apple shareholders, the key to deciding when to sell or trim positions lies in structural changes that disrupt the company’s investment thesis—a rare scenario for a company of Apple’s size. The ongoing trade war and the imposition of import tariffs, particularly those affecting China, could significantly impact Apple’s long-term outlook if these tariffs remain in place.\\n\\nHigher costs will probably lead to lower demand, especially for key products in Apple’s ecosystem, which could delay the company’s AI supercycle and even affect its Services business. In other words, this is a game changer — and not in winning way for AAPL shareholders. Given this scenario, and with the Trump administration struggling to negotiate better terms with key countries in Apple’s supply chain, I expect further losses ahead, with Apple likely underperforming the broader market.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.99931454658508,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:02:22 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.tipranks.com\",\n                \"title\": \"TipRanks\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"South Asia\",\n                \"North America\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n                \"Latin America & Caribbean\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -77.49965727329254,\n            \"second_model_score\": -55.00000000000001,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\",\n                \"Industrials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Apple's stock has suffered due to the ongoing tariff situation, erasing its gains from the past year.

While some analysts remain optimistic, others, including the author, recommend selling Apple stock due to uncertainty and the likelihood of further losses, especially if tariffs persist and impact China's reliance on Apple products.\",\n            \"tags\": [\n                \"apple\",\n                \"apple’s\",\n                \"china\",\n                \"s\",\n                \"stock\",\n                \"suppliers\",\n                \"tariffs\",\n                \"tariff\",\n                \"price\",\n                \"iphones\",\n                \"trade\",\n                \"sell\",\n                \"business\",\n                \"impact\",\n                \"aapl\",\n                \"company\",\n                \"costs\",\n                \"products\",\n                \"sales\",\n                \"company’s\",\n                \"past\",\n                \"production\",\n                \"rating\",\n                \"long-term\",\n                \"outlook\",\n                \"lead\",\n                \"let’s\",\n                \"33\",\n                \"mainland\",\n                \"manufacturing\",\n                \"country\",\n                \"supply\",\n                \"chain\",\n                \"iphone\",\n                \"000\"\n            ],\n            \"third_model_score\": 0,\n            \"title\": \"Why Buying The Dip on Apple Stock (AAPL) is a Bad Idea - TipRanks\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/why-buying-the-dip-on-apple-stock-aapl-is-a-bad-idea\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"agreement_rate\": 0,\n            \"company_names\": [\n                \"Apple Inc.\",\n                \"Constellation Brands\",\n                \"Best Buy\",\n                \"Ford Motor Company\",\n                \"Merck & Co.\",\n                \"Walmart\",\n                \"Target Corporation\",\n                \"Citigroup\",\n                \"Home Depot (The)\",\n                \"Pfizer\",\n                \"Constellation Energy\",\n                \"General Motors\"\n            ],\n            \"confidence\": 0,\n            \"description\": \"Check out the companies making headlines before the bell: Pharmaceutical stocks — Shares of U.S. companies in the pharmaceutical industry fell after President Donald Trump said late Tuesday that he is going to announce ” very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals .” Pfizer and Merck shares each dropped more than 4%, while Eli Lilly shed more than 3%. Apple — Shares fell more than 2% in the premarket, continuing to drop after a four-day losing streak that cost the tech giant roughly 25% of its market value. The iPhone maker has been hit hardest among the “Magnificent Seven” companies because of Apple’s reliance on China. Retailers — Many retail stocks fell before market open amid uncertainty about the potential effect of sweeping tariffs on trade partners and after China announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Target , Best Buy and Home Depot shares each slid about 3%. Walmart — Shares of the big-box retailer shed 1% after Walmart pulled its outlook for operating income in the first quarter, saying it wants to “maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented.” The company still expects sales to grow 3% to 4% during the three-month period. Automakers — Shares of automakers fell as the Trump administration’s tariffs on dozens of countries came into effect overnight. Ford and General Motors slipped 3% and 2%, respectively.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 28% share price drop in the last month. To make matters worse, the recent drop has wiped out a year's worth of gains with the share price now back where it started a year ago.\\n\\nEven after such a large drop in price, given close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or \\\"P/E's\\\") below 15x, you may still consider Apple as a stock to avoid entirely with its 26.9x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\\n\\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\\n\\nApple could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\\n\\nKeen to find out how analysts think Apple's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start .\\n\\nHow Is Apple's Growth Trending?\\n\\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Apple would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.\\n\\nTaking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 2.0%. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 5.4% in total. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\\n\\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 15% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 11% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.\\n\\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Apple's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.\\n\\nThe Key Takeaway\\n\\nEven after such a strong price drop, Apple's P/E still exceeds the rest of the market significantly. We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\\n\\nAs we suspected, our examination of Apple's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\\n\\nIt's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Apple , and understanding should be part of your investment process.\\n\\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks in focus.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump’s new tariff regimes have been introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. A 10% tariff was imposed on nearly all countries and territories this Saturday, with rates expected to escalate higher and become even more individualized for the “worst” offenders. In a tit-for-tat blow against Trump and his tariffs, China has moved to impose a 34% tax on all US goods.\\n\\nInvestment firm Wedbush has recently criticized these tariffs, citing them as a potential “economic Armageddon” for the U.S. tech sector. Analysts headed by Dan Ives believe that the impact of these tariffs could be even worse than previous major market crashes, such as the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. This could wipe out a decade of technological progress in the US.\\n\\nREAD ALSO: and .\\n\\n“The concept of taking the U.S. back to the 1980′s ‘manufacturing days’ with these tariffs is a bad science experiment that in the process will cause an economic Armageddon in our view and crush the tech trade, AI Revolution theme and overall industry in the process.”\\n\\nAnother investment firm, Bernstein, notes how China imports $10 billion worth of chips from the United States annually. $8 billion of these are Central Processing Units (CPUs) from Intel, commonly used in laptops and servers. Since China is its largest market in 2024, it will be impacted by the tariffs. Other companies being hit by the tariffs include Micron, considering some of its chips sold in China are imported from the US. This is despite the country having production facilities in China and other countries.\\n\\nAll in all, the firm is persistent that continued tariffs would imply lower growth, lower revenues, and lower profits for companies.\\n\\n“The higher than expected tariff rates … were not factored into many investors’ or companies’ calculations. The question is will there be enough time for them to actually get those numbers in in time? Because we don’t know what the retaliation measures are going to be from some of the European partners … or even from other countries, in that sort of scenario exact numbers might be lacking in some cases”.\\n\\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\\n\\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ().\\n\\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\\n\\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\\n\\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. On Monday, April 8, Wedbush reiterated the stock as “Outperform” and lowered its price target to $250 per share from $325.\\n\\n“At the current situation we do not expect most tech companies to give any guidance on the 1Q conference calls over the next month including Apple given too much uncertainty.”\\n\\nEven though there is massive uncertainty when it comes to stocks such as Apple, Ives asserted that it is still one of the top names to own in the market.\\n\\n“Today will be a scary day for investors (and us) … it will create opportunities and way oversold tech stocks but we need to essentially toss out the next few quarters and start to work with some new normal financial model for 2026 for valuations as this tariff situation settles into place during negotiations,” Ives said.\\n\\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of AI stocks in focus. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

The investment firm believes Apple could be exempted from the steep U.S. tariffs set to hit Chinese imports, considering the tech giant’s pledge to invest $500 billion in the country over the next four years. It further expects Apple to announce manufacturing commitments in the U.S., potentially including iPhone production.\\n\\nSpeaking of risks, Jefferies warned that Apple’s price could fall to around $150 if 54% tariff is imposed on the company. In the last five days, AAPL stock has tumbled over 20% as investor anxiety mounts over Trump’s tariffs potentially increasing iPhone prices. As of writing, the stock is trading at $172.42.\\n\\nJefferies Slashes Apple’s Earnings Outlook and Price Target\\n\\nDespite the rating upgrade, Jefferies’ five-star-rated analyst Edison Lee reduced his price target on AAPL stock to $167.88 from $202.33. The lower price target reflects worries that a global recession could hurt iPhone sales and expected price increases for upcoming models.\\n\\nAdditionally, Jefferies has lowered its iPhone shipment estimates for the next three years by 3.6% for 2025, 7.7% for 2026, and 5.5% for 2027, citing weaker demand. In terms of iPhone prices, it predicts a $50 hike for iPhone 18 models in 2026 (excluding the base version) and a $100 increase across all iPhone 19 models in 2027.\\n\\nOverall, Lee has cut its revenue forecasts by 2% to 4% and expects Apple’s earnings per share (EPS) to fall below market expectations by 2.5% to 8.5% over the same period.\\n\\nJefferies Flags AI Headwinds in Smartphones\\n\\nAnother major reason for the lowered estimates is concern over AI adoption on smartphones, including the iPhone. Lee pointed out two key challenges. First, the hardware just isn’t there yet. Without quicker memory and better tech design, iPhones can’t run large or powerful AI features. Second, the AI tools struggle to learn how people use their phones because they can’t access enough app info.\\n\\nThat said, Jefferies is optimistic. They believe the right hardware for bigger, smarter AI models will arrive by 2027 and Apple will likely be the first to use it in the iPhone 19.\\n\\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy?\\n\\nOn TipRanks, AAPL stock has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 33 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 17 Buy, 11 Hold, and five Sell recommendations assigned in the last three months.

Let’s dive into the major storylines below.\\n\\nChina Retaliates Against U.S. Tariffs\\n\\nAfter U.S. tariffs of 104% went into effect against China at midnight last night, the Chinese government responded by raising its rate on U.S. imports from 34% to 84%. The U.S. exports $143.5 billion worth of goods to China, whereas it imports $438.9 billion in goods.\\n\\nThat’s an overall small piece of America’s $28 trillion economy. However, China retaliating continues stoking fears that we’ll see a protracted trade war that could destabilize the global economy and leave the United States in a recession.\\n\\n10-Year Treasuries Surging\\n\\nAnother bad piece of economic news this morning is that the yield on 10-Year Treasuries is surging. One of the common thoughts on Wall Street has been that the Trump Administration is prioritizing the yields of Treasuries over the stock market. Lower treasury rates would help close the deficit by lowering interest costs and would also provide relief to parts of the economy that have been battered by higher rates – like housing.\\n\\nHowever, after rates initially plummeted following the announcement of Trump’s tariffs last Wednesday, they’re now surging. Across the past day the yield on the 10-Year Treasury has jumped an incredible .20%, and now stands at 4.46%.\\n\\nOverall, 10-Year Treasury rates have now jumped more than 50 basis points from where they traded on Monday morning. While the market has been selling off mostly on the potential for tariffs to cause a recession, rising rates are a new threat to the valuation of stocks.\\n\\nStocks to Watch on Wednesday Morning\\n\\nWith indexes down, there will be pain across most sectors today. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is down another 2% premarket after dropping 22% in the past five days. Nike (NYSE: NKE) is another stock that’s been hit hard by tariffs and is down 2% premarket.\\n\\nSome stocks that have been battered recently are holding up better than indexes. For example, NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) is actually up slightly in premarket trading even though indexes are sharply down.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.99400973320007,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:37:14 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://247wallst.com\",\n                \"title\": \"24/7 Wall St.\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -77.49700486660004,\n            \"second_model_score\": -55.00000000000001,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Global markets are facing another day of losses, triggered by China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports following new U.S. tariffs.

Meanwhile, Apple faces added vulnerability as its manufacturing operations in India, Vietnam, and Thailand are also subject to new U.S. tariffs.\\n\\nOver the past five trading sessions, AAPL stock has plunged 22% as investors grow increasingly concerned that Trump’s tariffs will drive iPhone prices higher.

Moreover, many supply chain experts believe full-scale U.S. iPhone production is simply unrealistic. Overall, Martin said Trump’s tariffs could drive Apple’s production costs up by roughly 50%.\\n\\nMartin isn’t alone. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives echoed the concern, estimating a U.S.-made iPhone could cost as much as $3,500.

With President Donald Trump imposing a staggering 104% tariff on Chinese imports and China responding with an 84% levy on US goods, industries reliant on cross-border supply chains and exports are reeling. This article dives into the American companies hit hardest by the trade war, exploring the real-world impacts on their operations, stock prices, and long-term prospects.\\n\\nApple ($AAPL): A Tech Titan Under Siege\\n\\nApple, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, is caught in the crosshairs of the trade war. With over 90% of its manufacturing based in China, the $AAPL stock plummeted 8.8% on a single day in early April, erasing over $300 billion in market capitalization. Analysts estimate that the 104% tariffs could saddle Apple with nearly $40 billion in additional costs annually, potentially slashing operating profits by a third if the company absorbs them. The iPhone, a flagship product, faces price hikes that could dampen consumer demand, while China’s retaliatory tariffs threaten Apple’s significant market share in the world’s largest smartphone market. The stakes are high for $AAPL as it navigates this tariff-induced storm.\\n\\nBoeing ($BA): Flying Into Turbulence\\n\\nBoeing, a cornerstone of American aerospace, is another casualty of the trade war’s escalation. China’s 84% tariffs on US goods directly target aircraft, making $BA’s planes far more expensive than competitors like Airbus and China’s COMAC. Already strained by past safety scandals and delivery delays, Boeing now faces a potential freeze on its 45-81 plane deliveries scheduled for 2025-2027 to China’s top airlines. The company’s reliance on China—one of its largest export markets—means these tariffs could slash revenues and cede market share to rivals. $BA’s stock has taken a hit, reflecting investor fears of a prolonged trade standoff.\\n\\nCaterpillar ($CAT): Digging a Deeper Hole\\n\\nCaterpillar, a titan in farm and construction equipment, is feeling the pinch from both sides of the tariff war. The $CAT stock is under pressure as China’s 84% tariffs compound an earlier 10% levy, targeting a sector already battered by slumping agricultural exports. China, a key market for $CAT’s machinery, buys billions in US equipment annually, but these tariffs threaten to choke demand. On the import side, higher costs for steel and components from China—vital to $CAT’s supply chain—could erode profit margins further. Analysts warn that prolonged trade tensions could force Caterpillar to rethink its global manufacturing footprint, a costly and uncertain pivot.\\n\\nDeere & Co. ($DE): Harvesting Losses\\n\\nThe agricultural sector, a long-standing victim of trade wars, sees Deere & Co. at the forefront of the fallout. $DE, a leading maker of tractors and farm equipment, is hit hard by China’s tariffs on US soybeans, pork, and other agricultural goods—products that drive demand for its machinery. With China historically snapping up over half of US soybean exports (valued at $15 billion), the 84% tariffs have redirected buyers to Brazil, leaving American farmers—and by extension, $DE—high and dry. The company has already cut production by 20% in response to earlier trade disruptions, and the latest tariffs could deepen those cuts, dragging $DE’s stock and outlook into the red.\\n\\nBroader Implications for USA-Listed Firms\\n\\nBeyond these giants, the ripple effects are stark. Tech firms like Intel ($INTC) and NVIDIA ($NVDA), reliant on China for semiconductor sales, face export hurdles, while retailers like Walmart ($WMT) and Nike ($NKE) grapple with rising costs for imported goods. The S&P 500 has suffered its worst losses since the 1950s, with trillions wiped off market values since Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2. American consumers, meanwhile, brace for higher prices on everything from smartphones to tractors, as companies weigh passing on costs or eating into profits.\\n\\nA Human Perspective on a Corporate Crisis\\n\\nBehind the stock tickers and balance sheets are real stakes: jobs, livelihoods, and economic stability. Farmers in the Midwest, already stung by lost export markets, see $DE’s woes as a reflection of their own. Factory workers at $CAT plants worry about layoffs if orders dry up. Even $AAPL’s retail staff feel the uncertainty as iPhone sales forecasts dim. This trade war isn’t just a numbers game—it’s a human story of adaptation and resilience in the face of policy upheaval.\\n\\nLooking Ahead: Can These Companies Recover?\\n\\nThe path forward is murky. Some firms, like $AAPL, might accelerate moves to diversify manufacturing—India and Vietnam are on the radar, though Trump’s tariffs on those nations (26% and 46%, respectively) complicate the shift. $BA could lean harder into domestic or European markets, but losing China’s growth potential stings. $CAT and $DE, tied to agriculture and construction cycles, may face years of adjustment if trade tensions persist. Investors, meanwhile, are left guessing: will Trump’s tariffs force a renegotiation, or are we in for a prolonged economic slugfest?\\n\\nThe US-China trade war, now at its fiercest, has turned USA-listed companies into unwilling frontline soldiers. For $AAPL, $BA, $CAT, $DE, and others, the battle is about survival—navigating tariffs, protecting profits, and preserving their place in a fracturing global economy. As the dust settles, one thing is clear: the casualties of this war extend far beyond the headlines.\\n\\nShayne Heffernan\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.99980926513672,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:11:59 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.livetradingnews.com\",\n                \"title\": \"livetradingnews.com\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"South Asia\",\n                \"North America\",\n                \"Latin America & Caribbean\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -79.99990463256836,\n            \"second_model_score\": -60.00000000000001,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Industrials\",\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\",\n                \"Consumer Staples\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"The US-China trade war is devastating USA-listed companies.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Walmart Inc. WMT, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, HSBC Holdings plc HSBC and Friedman Industries Inc. Common Stock FRD.\\n\\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\\n\\nTop Stock Reports for Walmart, Coca-Cola and HSBC\\n\\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc., The Coca-Cola Co. and HSBC Holdings plc, as well a micro-cap stock Friedman Industries Inc. Common Stock. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\\n\\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\\n\\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\\n\\nAhead of Wall Street\\n\\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company benefits from its diverse business model that spans multiple segments, channels and formats. The company's strong omnichannel strategy has boosted traffic across physical stores and digital platforms.\\n\\nWalmart's emphasis on improving delivery services has been successful, contributing to steady grocery market share gains. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year, and e-commerce sales surged.\\n\\nHowever, Walmart’s profitability is being impacted by rising selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, thanks to tech investments, higher wages and marketing. Also, volatile currency fluctuations are expected to further pressure sales in the upcoming fiscal year.\\n\\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\\n\\nShares of Coca-Cola have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+17.9% vs. +1.3%). The company has experienced positive business trends, as evident by its strong track record of beating expectations. In fourth-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the eighth consecutive quarter, with earnings showing year-over-year improvement.\\n\\nResults benefited from continued business momentum, aided by higher pricing across markets facing intense inflation and favorable mix. Coca-Cola's all-weather strategy -- combining marketing, innovation, and revenue growth management -- supports its vision of a total beverage company and is expected to drive revenue growth in 2025.\\n\\nCoca-Cola has provided an optimistic view for 2025. However, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.\\n\\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\\n\\nHSBC’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry over the past year (+28.5% vs. +8.3%). The company’s strong capital position, relatively high interest rates, global network and business simplification initiatives will keep supporting the company’s financials. As part of its Asia pivot strategy, it is moving away from less profitable markets and has announced the sale of businesses in Germany and South Africa.\\n\\nHSBC has exited retail operations in the U.S., Canada, France, New Zealand, Greece, Russia, Argentina and Armenia. While efforts to strengthen its market share in Asia will support financials, they will likely lead to an increase in expenses.\\n\\nFor 2025, the company expects operating expenses to increase 3%. Additionally, the company’s subdued revenue performance -- in light of weaker loan demand amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop -- is a concern.\\n\\n(You can read the full research report on HSBC here >>>)\\n\\nShares of Friedman Industries have underperformed the Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry over the past year (-24.6% vs. -1.4%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $97.38 million has seen fiscal third-quarter sales decline 18.9% year over year. The tubular segment remains weak and high inventory levels pose risks amid steel price volatility.\\n\\nRising costs and debt burdens could pressure profitability despite hedging strategies and operational efficiencies. Nevertheless, Friedman Industries' sales backlog grew 11% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025, signaling stronger demand and potential revenue recovery.\\n\\nPost-election stability has driven increased order activity, with fiscal fourth-quarter sales and margin expansion expected as hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices rebound. Debt fell 9% to $32.5 million, with $99.2 million in available credit supporting operations. Industry tailwinds include a projected increase in HRC prices and rising infrastructure and manufacturing investments.\\n\\n(You can read the full research report on Friedman Industries here >>>)\\n\\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\\n\\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.\\n\\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\\n\\nSee Stocks Free >>\\n\\nZacks Investment Research\\n\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\n\\nsupport@zacks.com\\n\\nhttps://www.zacks.com\\n\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Despite being in the top 4% of UK earners, only one in 10 people earning £100,000 or more would describe themselves as ‘wealthy’, while only 1% of the UK population identify as such. High earners also place the threshold for wealth much higher, citing £724,000 as the income it takes to be considered wealthy.\\n\\nDespite being in the top 4%, high earners position themselves in the top 52% relative to the rest of the UK population, just above average[2]. This highlights a significant disconnect between perceived and actual financial position and hinting to how many high earners self-identify as the ‘squeezed middle’. This is despite HSBC UK Premier customers having five times more savings and three times more money coming in and out compared to most HSBC UK customers.\\n\\nPerceptions of wealth don’t just differ across income level. The report reveals that there are also distinct regional differences both in wealth and the way it is perceived. Londoners surveyed said that it takes more than £289,000 to be wealthy on average. Meanwhile, those in the Northeast say it’s an average of £80,000.\\n\\nHigher earners aiming high in terms of goals\\n\\nHSBC UK’s analysis reveals that high earners often have ambitious financial goals, but just under half (44%) of those with financial goals feel they are on track to achieve them. This drops significantly to only one in five (21%) of the general population. Despite not feeling on track to meet their goals, most people are optimistic about their financial futures, with 95% of high earners and 85% of the general population believing that their financial goals are achievable.\\n\\nWhen it comes to financial ambitions among high earners, almost half (48%) are aiming for a comfortable retirement, home ownership (30%), or want to make significant home improvements (20%). But the need to prioritise more immediate costs (27%), insufficient savings (11%), and unpredictable income (14%) remain challenging, even for this more affluent group.\\n\\nCredit plays an important part in helping higher earners manage their day-to-day finances. HSBC UK customer data shows that Premier customers are nearly twice as likely than most HSBC customers to also hold a HSBC UK credit card, although maximizing points and benefits will be a key driver of this trend. Meanwhile, one in 10 HSBC Premier-qualified customers are using their overdrafts regularly, compared to one in six general population customers.\\n\\nVicky Reynal, Financial Psychotherapist, said: “HSBC UK’s findings reveal a paradox: despite having high earnings and ambitious financial goals, many mass affluent individuals still don’t feel wealthy. This disconnect underscores the psychology behind people’s perceptions of wealth.\\n\\n“Anxieties about rising costs, inadequate savings, and the pressure of social comparison create a sense of scarcity, even when objective wealth exists. By redefining wealth beyond the bank balance, focusing on our achievements, reducing unhelpful comparisons, and prioritising financial actions within our control, people can move confidently toward the future they aspire to.”\\n\\nInvestments key indicator of wealth for more than half of Brits\\n\\nHSBC UK also explores diverse attitudes towards signifiers of wealth. While over half (51%) of the general population identifies owning a private jet or a yacht (48%) as the main signifier of wealth, high earners are more likely to consider non-material factors – such as retiring early (48%), frequently travelling abroad (45%) or having investments (54%) – as more relevant symbols.\\n\\nInvestments have emerged as critical markers of wealth across the board, with 49% of the general population seeing this as a key signifier of wealth. While the majority (55%) of those earning over £100K have investments, this figure drops dramatically to just 18% of the general population.\\n\\nAlmost half (49%) of Gen Z (18–24-year-olds) consider wealth in non-material terms, compared to one third (35%) of those aged 35-44. When it comes to high earning 18–24-year-olds, one third believe that having a strong work-life balance is a strong signifier of wealth, and 41% are aspiring to this in the next two years.\\n\\nAmong the nationally representative sample, this generation is also likely to be proactive and open about their finances, with nearly half of 18–24-year-olds saying they like talking about money compared to just 3% of over 55s. This proactivity is reflected in their investment behaviour, with nearly half (43%) of high earners in this group already having an investment portfolio, and less than one in five (17%) of those in the nationally representative sample are aspiring to do so.\\n\\nXian Chan, Head of Premier Wealth, HSBC UK said: “Wealth is a deeply personal concept, that is dependent not only on people’s objective financial position but also on how they feel about money.\\n\\n“People often evaluate their sense of wealth in relation to how financially secure they feel, and how close they are to being able to achieve their financial goals. But the key for everyone is in early preparation. Investments remain the most significant signifier of wealth, and adding to those gradually over the long-term is a crucial step for building towards prosperity. Starting to save even a small amount regularly, and as early as possible, while developing regular habits, is one of the most important things that we can do to plan successfully for our financial futures.\\n\\n“At HSBC UK, we’re committed to working with our customers to help them define wealth for themselves, take control of their futures, and start building towards their aspirations – whether they’re already on their wealth journey, or just starting out.”\\n\\nHSBC UK’s latest report reveals a shift to a more holistic view of wealth among high earners. The bank’s new, enhanced Premier offer features tailored benefits across health, wealth, international and travel. From comprehensive healthcare cover to lounge access and personalised wealth management, the new Premier offer caters to high earners looking to build and grow their wealth, whatever their ambitions may be.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 0,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 09:10:11 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://londonlovesbusiness.com\",\n                \"title\": \"London Business News\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"Europe & Central Asia\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 4.5,\n            \"second_model_score\": 15,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"neutral\",\n            \"summary\": \"An HSBC UK report reveals a disconnect between perceived and actual wealth.

Provides Update on Tembo Project Following Mining License Conversion\\n\\nLake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF), an emerging East African gold developer, today announced an update on the Company's Tembo Project, located in the Lake Victoria Goldfield of northern Tanzania, following the successful conversion of its Prospecting License into four Mining Licenses (MLs).\\n\\nThe milestone marks a significant advancement in LVG's strategy to unlock the potential of Tembo, which has already benefited from over US$28 million in exploration expenditures, including 50,000 meters of diamond and RC drilling. The conversion from a Prospecting License to four Mining Licenses grants LVG the legal right to develop and produce from the Tembo Project. Key provisions include that each Mining License (ML) is valid for 10 years, with the option of a further 10-year renewal.\\n\\n\\\"The approval of our Mining Licenses is a pivotal step forward for the Tembo Project,\\\" said Marc Cernovitch, President & CEO of Lake Victoria Gold. \\\"We have always believed in the district-scale potential of this asset. With tenure now secured for the next 10 years, we can focus on evaluating the most efficient development options to unlock maximum shareholder value. This is a transformational moment for the Company and its stakeholders.\\\"\\n\\nArmed with data obtained from the already mentioned +$28 million already invested into exploration at this site in Tanzania, Lake Victoria Gold (LVG) has zeroed in on three high-priority targets showing impressive gold grades and real growth potential.\\n\\nAt Ngula 1, drilling has revealed a 250-meter-wide zone made up of multiple gold-bearing structures that run at least 600 meters in length, and remain open for expansion both deeper and farther out. Some of the more exciting drill results here include hits like 3.13 grams per tonne (g/t) of gold over nearly 26 meters, and an especially rich interval of 22.18 g/t over 15 meters. These numbers point to both strong grade and size—two ingredients that matter when assessing the economic potential of a gold deposit.\\n\\nThe Nyakagwe Village target is just as exciting. Here, multiple mineralized structures have produced gold grades as high as 78.1 g/t over one meter and 27.88 g/t over nearly four meters. These are high-grade zones that could feed either near-term mining efforts or future development plans.\\n\\nAt Nyakagwe East, drilling has uncovered a 300-meter-wide zone with strong quartz veining and visible sulphide mineralization. Results include intercepts like 19.1 g/t over three meters and 10.25 g/t over 3.5 meters—once again reinforcing the project's high-grade profile.\\n\\nWith Mining Licenses now secured, LVG is evaluating multiple options for how to move Tembo forward. First, there's real near-term production potential. Some of the shallow, high-grade areas could potentially be mined using open pits once a little more drilling is done, while nearby third-party facilities may allow the company to start producing gold without having to build its own plant right away. Longer term, LVG may still consider building a dedicated processing facility if production volumes justify it.\\n\\nOn the exploration side, there's still plenty of runway for growth. A new drill program is being designed to follow up on historical high-grade hits and convert them into formal resource estimates. A also identified 38 new exploration targets on the property—suggesting that the current high-grade zones might just be the beginning. More fieldwork is underway to test these areas for additional gold discoveries.\\n\\nFinally, LVG is keeping the door open for potential partnerships or strategic deals. The Tembo Project sits right next to Barrick's massive Bulyanhulu Mine, and the two companies already have a relationship. Back in 2021, LVG to Barrick for $6 million in cash and up to $45 million more in potential contingent payments, which is essentially a bonus if Barrick finds gold on the ground it bought. That deal gave LVG funding to focus on Tembo, while still allowing it to benefit from discoveries made next door. Looking ahead, LVG now has fresh 10-year Mining Licenses at two promising assets.\\n\\n\\\"We believe Tembo represents a rare opportunity to define a new gold camp in one of Tanzania's most historically productive districts,\\\" said Simon Benstead, Executive Chairman of Lake Victoria Gold. \\\"With multiple exploration and development levers available to us, and a supportive regulatory environment, we're committed to responsibly unlocking the full value of this high-potential asset.\\\"\\n\\nCONTINUED… Read this and more news for Lake Victoria Gold at:\\n\\nIn other industry developments and happenings in the market include:\\n\\nNew Gold Inc. (NYSE-American: NGD) (TSX: NGD) has the remaining 19.9% free cash flow interest in its New Afton copper-gold mine from the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan for $300 million. The deal will be funded through a mix of available cash, a credit facility, and a gold prepayment arrangement that covers about 8% of New Gold's expected gold production over the next year.\\n\\n\\\"This is an excellent transaction allowing New Gold to fully consolidate the free cash flow exposure to one of Canada's highest quality gold/copper assets, which we already own and operate,\\\" said New Gold president and CEO Patrick Godin. \\\"This transaction allows us to grow in an exceptional location with no diligence or integration risk, and with no equity dilution to our shareholders.\\\"\\n\\nThis move gives New Gold full 100% free cash flow exposure to New Afton, one of Canada's top-tier gold-copper assets. Godin also highlighted that with the ramp up of the C-Zone, New Afton is on the verge of exceptional production growth and cost improvement, which should lead to increased free cash flow generation.\\n\\nThor Explorations Ltd. (TSXV: THX) (OTCPK: THXPF) recently , highlighted by 85,057 ounces of gold poured at its Segilola Gold Mine in Nigeria and the announcement of its maiden dividend. The company also advanced exploration across Nigeria, Senegal, and Côte d'Ivoire, with positive drill results at the Douta project and the discovery of a promising new zone at Baraka 3.\\n\\n\\\"In 2025, the Group's strategy will be focussed on increasing shareholder value by extending the Segilola mine life and advancing the Douta Project in Senegal,\\\" said Segun Lawson, President and CEO of Thor Explorations. \\\"At the same time, we are encouraged by the early exploration results on our newly assembled portfolio in Côte d'Ivoire. We look forward to advancing these projects through 2025.\\\"\\n\\nIn Côte d'Ivoire, Thor expanded its presence with new acquisitions and began early-stage exploration on several permits. Looking ahead to 2025, Thor has guided for gold production between 85,000–95,000 ounces and plans to spend up to $17.5 million on exploration across West Africa. Backed by strong cash flow and a debt-free balance sheet, Thor is now positioned to self-fund its growth while returning capital to shareholders.\\n\\nWESTGOLD RESOURCES LIMITED (TSX: WGX) (OTCPK: WGXRF) has with New Murchison Gold for the Crown Prince gold deposit in Western Australia. Under the deal, Westgold will acquire between 30,000 and 50,000 tonnes of ore per month from the deposit, located just 33km from its Bluebird processing facility in Meekatharra.\\n\\nOre shipments must meet a minimum gold grade of 1.5 g/t and will be transported by road for processing as part of Westgold's Murchison operations. This agreement strengthens Westgold's regional ore supply as it continues to evaluate long-term growth options across its Western Australia asset base.\\n\\nDakota Gold Corp.

The asset class can offer alternative sources of risk-adjusted returns, pay more than traditional fixed income, and provide potential for spread compression as an additional layer of return. Taking a global and dynamic investment approach allows investors to unlock the complexity and illiquidity premiums on offer within this asset class.\\n\\nAllocating to Securitised Credit\\n\\nSecuritised Credit has a low correlation to traditional fixed income. Over a 14-year period to December 2024, the HSBC Global Investment Grade Securitised Credit Composite had a 0.46 correlation to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Corporate Index. This makes sense, given its distinctive return, volatility, and duration profile. For a multi-asset allocator, this makes a compelling diversification case.\\n\\nSecuritised Credit has had higher returns than fixed income corporates and government bonds over the longer term. It has also had a lower volatility and thus higher Sharpe ratios over the past 14 years.\\n\\nOn top of having low correlations to traditional fixed income, Securitised Credit also benefits from a complexity premium, as it is an over-the-counter (OTC) hand traded market, which requires deep credit research resources to unlock value. There is also an illiquidity premium, as the asset class is slightly less liquid than corporate bonds across the rating stack. Although, this is less pronounced for higher rated securities than the lower rated ones.\\n\\nAs a result of this, even during periods where interest rates are low and coupons are lower, spreads will likely remain above that of traditional fixed income, making an allocation to high quality Securitised Credit an interesting option for investors in 2025.\\n\\nMoving on from the 60/40 portfolio\\n\\nTraditional fixed income has historically been viewed as a diversifier to equities and we are all well versed with the “60–40” portfolio.\\n\\nHowever, the “lower-for-longer” interest rate environment, the “Great Fixed Income Reset” and now a potential “higher-for-longer” scenario, have forced investors to reconsider their asset allocations.\\n\\nNot only does Securities Credit have a low correlation to traditional fixed income, it also has a lower correlation to US equities than corporate bonds, making it a key consideration for multi-asset investors. Comparing traditional High Yield corporate bonds to the S&P 500, the correlation is as high as 0.8. However, when comparing Securitised Credit against the S&P 500, we see correlations as low as 0.29 across major sectors within this asset class.\\n\\nThe demand is there\\n\\nAnother key consideration for institutional investors is the returns, regulatory and operational benefits that a Securitised Credit allocation can provide. For insurance companies, subject to the underlying applied regulatory environment, it offers higher returns than traditional fixed income across all credit ratings with similar credit charges. For pension funds, and particularly LDI strategies, Securitised Credit can provide balance to their collateral waterfall, and it can provide liquidity when it is so desperately needed. Other pension schemes have previously allocated to illiquid private debt, with the trend now being a reversal into more liquid Securitised Credit.\\n\\nOther than pension and insurance firms, multi-asset allocators like the low correlation and diversification benefits whilst Private Banks and Family Offices like the income generation. Furthermore, Corporate Treasurers, looking for an alternative to cash, have been allocating to Securitised Credit within their strategic cash bucket.\\n\\nSecuritised Credit serves a variety of purposes across varying investor profiles. Thus, it should come as no surprise that this clientele will most likely continue to allocate to the sector.\\n\\n2025’s path for Securitised Credit\\n\\nSecuritised Credit has and is expected to continue to benefit from the current macroeconomic environment. High interest rates have meant that the asset class is generating high levels of income.\\n\\nThe future direction for interest rates is likely to be downwards. Although we don’t know the size and speed of cuts, the destination is unlikely to be zero. Interest rates are more likely to move to a more neutral rate. As Securitised Credit generated positive returns when interest rates were zero, it is likely the asset class will continue to make money as interest rates fall.\\n\\nInterest rate cuts will be beneficial for the asset class, as this will make servicing the underlying debt more manageable (hence reducing loan defaults and delinquencies) whilst income generation on the floating rate bonds remains significant. This would also lead to potential spread tightening, allowing investors to benefit from a capital gain.\\n\\nFor a strategic asset allocator, the unique return profile, low correlations to traditional asset classes and superior Sharpe ratios make it an important consideration.\\n\\nAndrew Jackson is Head of Portfolio Management, Securitised Credit and Paul Mitchell is Senior Investment Specialist Global, Securitised & Sterling Fixed Income\\n\\nSource: HSBC Asset Management as at 31/01/25.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 99.98178482055664,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 10:17:29 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://funds-europe.com\",\n                \"title\": \"Funds Europe\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 77.49089241027832,\n            \"second_model_score\": 55.00000000000001,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n            \"summary\": \"Securitized Credit offers diversification, higher risk-adjusted returns, and yield enhancement compared to traditional fixed income.

approach to retirement solutions across Asia has earned it a Marquee Award in a strongly contested category.\\n\\nWith a global pension footprint spanning nearly nine million plan members, Manulife has retained leadership in key markets including Hong Kong, where it serves over one-third of all MPF members and has led the market in AUM share since 2016.\\n\\nOver the eligibility period, the firm achieved 16.8% year-on-year AUM growth and a 32.5% rise in net flows, supported by exceptional fund performance and the launch of market-first ESG MPF fund conversions.\\n\\n“It has a huge AUM in Hong Kong alone,” judges said. “But it adds to that strong client growth and a better than reasonable performance.”\\n\\nJudges were also impressed by the firm’s strong digital transformation.\\n\\nWith over 50% of MPF clients now engaging through digital tools, Manulife’s partnership with WealthTech firms and launch of an AI-powered MPF robo-advisor has materially improved user engagement and retention.\\n\\nIt also retained 50% of retiree MPF assets, a testament to its well-executed rollover strategies.\\n\\nBeyond investment returns, Manulife has actively led retirement education through initiatives like the “DiverseAsia” series and its Participant Profiling Tool, further enhancing financial literacy across six Asian markets.\\n\\nBest Pension Asset Manager (Highly Commended): HSBC Asset Management\\n\\nHSBC Asset Management earned a Highly Commended award in this category for its depth of capability and continued innovation in serving pension clients across Asia.\\n\\nWith a pension AUM of over $40 billion and long-standing relationships across defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, the firm demonstrated strong regional momentum — winning new mandates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Thailand — while growing MPF multi-asset AUM by 22% year-on-year.\\n\\n“HSBC is very competitive in this space,” judges noted.\\n\\nThe launch of the HSBC Post Retirement Multi-Asset Fund, Hong Kong’s first mutual fund designed specifically for retirees, reflected a thoughtful commitment to evolving investor needs.\\n\\nIts flexible 6% payout model and broad diversification also made it a standout post-retirement product.\\n\\nHSBC’s proprietary digital tools, including robo-advisory developments and fund optimisation platforms, further enhanced its standing.\\n\\nJudges also highlighted its consistent above-median MPF fund performance and the strength of its regional multi-asset team.\\n\\nAlthough HSBC AM is among the largest players in the market, it continues to take a client-centric approach, tailoring solutions for investors at different life stages. This blend of institutional heft and focused innovation underscored the firm’s role in shaping Asia’s pension landscape.\\n\\nBest Thematic Fund House: Pictet Asset Management\\n\\nDespite a challenging macro backdrop, Pictet delivered over 10% AUM growth year-on-year to maintain its position as the world’s largest active thematic fund provider.\\n\\nAs the leading manager of environmental thematic funds, according to Morningstar, Pictet continues to set the global benchmark with $67 billion in thematic equity AUM across 17 strategies as of October 2024.\\n\\nPerformance was its standout feature.\\n\\nIts Clean Energy Transition and Global Environmental Opportunities strategies delivered top-quartile returns, with one-year gains of 22.97% and 24.67% respectively, and five-year cumulative returns significantly outpacing peers.\\n\\nPictet’s strength in tech thematics also endured, with the Robotics and Digital funds delivering robust growth and strong investor traction in Asia.\\n\\nPictet’s innovation in thematic private equity — raising over $1 billion across environment, tech and health-focused co-investment funds — marked a key evolution of its thematic leadership from public to private markets.\\n\\nThe firm also broke new ground with its proprietary biodiversity impact tool, enabling investors to quantify species loss risk in supply chains, helping meet growing demand for nature-aligned strategies.\\n\\nWith a proven framework and expanding toolkit, Pictet AM continues to offer relevant solutions for institutions seeking long-term thematic exposure.\",\n            \"finbert_score\": 99.99999403953552,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:16:34 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://www.asianinvestor.net\",\n                \"title\": \"AsianInvestor\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": 82.49999701976776,\n            \"second_model_score\": 65,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Information Technology\",\n                \"Financials\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bullish\",\n            \"summary\": \"AsianInvestor announced its 2024 Asset Management Awards' marquee winners.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\\n\\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Exxon Mobil (XOM).\\n\\nExxon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\\n\\nOf the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy, representing 59.3% of all recommendations.\\n\\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for XOM\\n\\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Exxon here>>>The ABR suggests buying Exxon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\\n\\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \\\"Strong Sell\\\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \\\"Strong Buy\\\" recommendations.\\n\\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\\n\\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\\n\\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\\n\\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\\n\\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\\n\\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\\n\\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\\n\\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\\n\\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\\n\\nIs XOM Worth Investing In?\\n\\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Exxon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 3.7% over the past month to $7.13.\\n\\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\\n\\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Exxon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\\n\\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Exxon with a grain of salt.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The U.S. and China are trying to outdo one another by ratcheting up tariffs on imports. Treasury yields are soaring, which could raise borrowing costs, but might force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\\n\\nWith investors perpetually wary of the next stock market meltdown, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM) stands out as a popular choice for those seeking stability and income. With its focus on high-dividend-paying, large-cap U.S. stocks, VYM promises a blend of yield and resilience. Yet can it really weather a severe market downturn?\\n\\nA bulwark against volatility\\n\\nVanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, holding over 500 stocks with a median market cap of around $148.5 billion. Its top holdings are giants like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\\n\\nThese represent stable, blue-chip companies across diverse sectors: technology, financials, energy, consumer staples, and retail. This diversification is a key strength of the ETF. By spreading risk across industries, VYM avoids the pitfalls of over-concentration, a common vulnerability in sector-specific funds during crashes. Its market-cap-weighted approach further tilts it toward larger, more established firms, which tend to have deeper resources to endure economic storms compared to smaller, riskier companies.\\n\\nThe ETF’s dividend yield, hovering around 1.4%, is another pillar of its appeal. In a meltdown, when stock prices plummet, dividends can provide a cushion, offering steady income even as capital values erode.\\n\\nReliance upon strong dividend payers\\n\\nHistorically, dividend-paying stocks have outperformed non-dividend peers during bear markets. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, high-dividend stocks in the S&P 500 fell less than the broader index, or about 40% versus 50%, hanks to their cash flow stability. VYM’s focus on stocks with consistent, above-average dividends aligns with this trend, suggesting it could mitigate losses better than growth-heavy ETFs.\\n\\nCost efficiency is another argument in VYM’s favor. With an expense ratio of just 0.03%, it’s a bargain compared to the 0.89% average for similar funds. In a prolonged downturn, where every dollar counts, low fees preserve returns, making VYM a practical choice for long-term investors.\\n\\nOver the past five years, it has delivered an 82% price gain (excluding dividends), showing it can thrive in bull markets while still offering income — a dual advantage that could soften the blow of a crash. Reinvesting those dividends, however, boosts VYM’s total return to almost 96%.\\n\\nSolid, but not unbreakable\\n\\nYet, VYM isn’t invincible. Its heavy weighting in tech (30% of the portfolio) and financials (14.5%) exposes it to sector-specific risks. Another tech wreck could send shares plunging or a meltdown triggered by a banking crisis, say, from rising loan defaults in a recession, could hit this allocation hard, as seen in 2008 when financial stocks cratered. While diversification helps, it doesn’t eliminate these vulnerabilities entirely.\\n\\nHistorical context offers mixed signals. In the pandemic crash of March 2020, VYM dropped about 35% from its peak, roughly in line with the S&P 500’s 34% decline. It recovered quickly, buoyed by its stable holdings and dividend income, but the initial fall shows it’s not immune to panic selling.\\n\\nA deeper, more structural meltdown if we suffer stagflation through high inflation and low growth, might test it further. Rising rates could pressure dividend stock valuations, and if companies cut payouts to preserve cash (as some did in 2020), VYM’s yield advantage could erode.\\n\\nEconomic conditions this year add complexity. With inflation cooling, but recession fears lingering, the Fed’s next moves are critical. Rate cuts could lift VYM’s large-cap stocks, but a severe downturn might overwhelm even the sturdiest portfolios. VYM’s trailing P/E ratio of 24.7 suggests it’s overvalued despite the stock being down 15% year-to-date.\\n\\nKey takeaway\\n\\nUltimately, VYM’s survival hinges on its design: broad exposure, low costs, and a dividend focus rooted in quality firms.

Here is a list of potential beneficiaries and losers of the new trade policy.\\n\\nWhat Happened: While the tariffs of U.S. trading partners have had a damaging effect on the stock market, they have also fueled the fear of a slowdown in the economy and a possible recession.\\n\\nAccording to John Murillo, the chief dealing officer at a global fintech solutions provider for financial institutions, B2BROKER, Trump's tariffs preemptively target metals, cars, and high-tech imports into the U.S., which seemingly spells trouble, “specifically for these sectors.”\\n\\nHowever, he goes on to add that the “devil is always hiding in the details,” and sees the protectionist measures as a silver lining for the American automotive sector, predicting increased demand due to reduced foreign competition.\\n\\n“Since tariffs are imposed on foreign cars competing with U.S. cars for consumer preferences, it will be precisely the American automotive industry that reaps the fruit of this protectionism,” Murillo told Benzinga.\\n\\nMurillo states that despite the initial negative reaction following a cut in dividends by the Ford Motor Co. F executives, “Ford and General Motors Co. GM will see higher demand on their production over time, which will offset all current inconveniences with reorientation for alternative foreign supply parts producers.”\\n\\n“We must also not forget Donald Trump‘s bet on the American oil industry,” adds Murillo, stating that he will “zealously protect American businesses, and we know that conventional energy is the subject of his special focus.”\\n\\n“He is expected to fight with big oil companies worldwide in every possible way, and this is very positive news for the U.S. oil stocks despite the current softness of oil prices,” which will especially benefit classic oil producers like Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Chevron Corp. CVX, according to Murillo.\\n\\nSee Also: Cathie Wood Points To ‘Serious Liquidity Issues’ As Overnight Borrowing Rate Spreads Widen On Spiking Treasury Yields\\n\\nWhy It Matters: Tariffs are considered protectionist policies as they are taxes that a government levies on imported goods. The primary objective of tariffs is to protect domestic industries that produce the same or similar goods.\\n\\nHowever, they could lead to an increase in the prices of goods as the cost of producing the goods domestically increases.\\n\\nMurillo also highlights the companies that will lose out because of these policies in the long run.\\n\\n“The most evident losers will be retail stocks, such as Costco Wholesale Corp. COST and Walmart Inc. WMT, which traditionally formed most of their margins by arbitraging Chinese wholesale versus U.S. domestic retail prices.”\\n\\n“PC, server, and phone equipment manufacturers like HP Inc. HPQ, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, and Apple Inc. AAPL will also feel the heat because many essential parts have been delivered from China for decades,” he adds.\\n\\nPrice Action: Notably, on Tuesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY decreased by 1.57% to $496.48, while the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF QQQ saw a decline of 1.80% to $416.06, according to Benzinga Pro data.\\n\\nFollowing Tuesday’s trading session, the Nasdaq 100 is in bear market territory, having fallen 23.10% from its prior peak of 22,222.61. The S&P 500 also saw a significant decline of 18.95% from its Feb. 19 high of 6,147.43, while the Dow Jones was down 16.48% from its 52-week high.\\n\\nWednesday’s futures market indicated further potential losses, with Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 futures all trading lower.\\n\\nRead Next:\\n\\nBear Markets Hit Harder And Last Longer During Recessions, Says Strategist\\n\\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\",\n            \"finbert_score\": -99.97952987890673,\n            \"published date\": \"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 08:23:09 GMT\",\n            \"publisher\": {\n                \"href\": \"https://in.benzinga.com\",\n                \"title\": \"Benzinga\"\n            },\n            \"regions\": [\n                \"North America\",\n                \"East Asia & Pacific\"\n            ],\n            \"score\": -79.83979858230623,\n            \"second_model_score\": -59.859693627318755,\n            \"sectors\": [\n                \"Consumer Discretionary\",\n                \"Consumer Staples\",\n                \"Materials\",\n                \"Energy\",\n                \"Information Technology\"\n            ],\n            \"sentiment\": \"bearish\",\n            \"summary\": \"An analyst believes Trump's tariffs, despite hurting the stock market, could benefit the U.S. automotive and oil industries by reducing foreign competition.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Chevron Corp.

This sell-off looks like a great opportunity for long-term investors to get exposure to the fintech space.\\n\\nAbout the Company\\n\\nAffirm was founded in 2012 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The stock is valued at $12 billion, and the company employs 2,000.\\n\\nThe company provides flexible payment solutions through its platform, which includes a consumer-facing app, merchant commerce tools, and point-of-sale financing. Backed by partnerships with banks, Affirm enables customers to buy now and pay over time, without hidden fees or compounding interest.\\n\\nAffirm's services power transactions for a diverse range of merchants, from small businesses to large enterprises, across sectors including travel, fashion, home goods, sporting equipment, electronics, and general retail.\\n\\nThe stock has a Zacks Style Score of “B” in Growth and “A” in Momentum. However, AFRM has an “F” score in Value.\\n\\nQ2 Earnings Beat\\n\\nThe company last reported earnings back in February posting an EPS beat of 215%. With that. The company beat on revenues and raised guidance.\\n\\nQ3 revenues are now seen at $755-785M, above the $773M expected. FY25 revenues were taken up to $3.13-3.19B v the $3.11B expected.\\n\\nActive Merchants were 337.2K v the 323K last quarter while Active Consumers were 21M v the 19.5M last quarter.\\n\\nAffirm’s management highlighted a record-breaking holiday season, with standout growth across key categories like third-party marketplaces (up 44%) and travel (up 42%), and a 113% year-over-year jump in Affirm Card GMV. A major driver was 70% growth in 0% APR GMV. The company is nearing profitability ahead of its target, citing strong operating leverage, resilient unit economics, and confidence in navigating high-rate environments. Leadership emphasized Affirm’s competitive edge in credit performance, merchant trust, and consumer experience.\\n\\nEstimates Headed Higher\\n\\nThe company has seen analyst estimates go higher across most time frames.\\n\\nFor the current quarter, estimates have gone from -$0.15 to -$0.07 over the last 90 days. Next quarter, the move has stayed flat over the last 90 days, with analysts seeing $0.09.\\n\\nFor the current year, estimates have jumped from $-0.55 to -$0.10 since that earnings report. And for next year, estimates have gone from $0.50 to $0.61. This is a move of 18% over the last 90 days.\\n\\nAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Affirm Holdings, Inc. Quote\\n\\nSince earnings, there have been a handful of firms reiterating their buy ratings:\\n\\nBMO Capital Markets resumed AFRM with Outperform, with a price target of $69.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs reiterated AFRM with Buy with a price target of $56.\\n\\nTD Cowen initiates AFRM with Buy and a price target of $50.\\n\\nThe Technical Take\\n\\nAFRM started the year strong, moving from $50-80 in the first six weeks. However, the stock has seen a violent correction with the recent market weakness.\\n\\nThe stock looks to have bottomed around the $30 area and is starting to bounce. There seems to be more meat on the bone here with the moving averages significant above current trading levels.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at some potential resistance:\\n\\n21-day: $46.00\\n\\n200-day: $48.25\\n\\n50-day: $57.20\\n\\nFibonacci resistance: $62\\n\\nWhile the stock might find a hard time lifting with the ongoing market weakness. Investors should keep an eye on these levels for profit taking.\\n\\nIn Summary\\n\\nAffirm is showing strong momentum as it nears profitability, backed by robust revenue growth, expanding user and merchant bases, and increasing analyst confidence.\\n\\nWith a record-setting holiday quarter, raised guidance, and improving estimates, the company is proving its ability to thrive even in a higher-rate environment.\\n\\nWhile the stock has pulled back from its early-year highs, the recent bounce and positive technical setup suggest further upside potential. For investors seeking growth and momentum in the fintech space, AFRM is a name worth watching closely.\\n\\nBear of the Day:\\n\\nRH is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that operates as a retailer and lifestyle brand in the home furnishings market. The company offers products in various categories, including furniture, lighting, textiles, bath ware, décor, outdoor and garden, baby, child, and teen furnishings.\\n\\nThe company faces headwinds from tariffs and a slumping stock market. And if that was not enough, the stock just dropped over 40% and earnings last week.\\n\\nWhile this might be a bargain in the long-run, investors should be cautious as the stock likely is in store for a rough 2025.\\n\\nAbout the Company\\n\\nRH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc., rebranded in 2017 and is headquartered in Corte Madera, California.\\n\\nFounded in 1980, the company markets its luxury home furnishings through multiple channels, including its website, hospitality spaces, sourcebooks, trade and contract programs, and a network of RH Galleries, outlet stores, guesthouses, Interior Design offices, and Waterworks showrooms.\\n\\nRH is valued at $3 billion and has a Forward PE of 15. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “F” in Growth and “D” in Value.\\n\\nQ4 Earnings\\n\\nRH reported earnings on April 2nd, seeing a17% EPS miss. The company also posted a revenue miss and guided FY25 revenue growth +10-13%.\\n\\nManagement struck a cautious tone looking forward, pointing to a riskier business environment shaped by macroeconomic pressures and ongoing tariff uncertainty. Tariffs from key sourcing countries like China, Canada, and Mexico remain a major headwind, with the potential to shift quickly. Some rates may drop from 45% to 25%, but timing and policy direction remain unclear.\\n\\nWhile RH is attempting to mitigate these pressures through supplier negotiations and by leveraging its scale, the unpredictability of tariffs continues to weigh on margins and adds complexity to near-term planning.\\n\\nThe stock dropped from the $240 level all the way to $123 the next day. It has since bounced 40 points, but investors might want to take off risk as analysts lower their earnings estimates.\\n\\nEarnings Estimates Falling\\n\\nSince reporting earnings, estimates have fallen off a cliff.\\n\\nOver the last 7 days, analysts have taken numbers down a staggering 79% for the current quarter. The drop, from $1.43 to $0.30, reflects the short-term pain.\\n\\nBut the trouble continues, with next quarter's numbers falling 10%, going from $3.95 to $3.56.\\n\\nThe current year’s estimates go from $13.26 to $11.00, or a drop of 17%.\\n\\nNext year, numbers over the last 7 days have gone from $19.89 to $15.92, a 20% reduction in the consensus.\\n\\nTechnical Take\\n\\nThe stock is trading at lows not seen since COVID. From those lows in 2020, the stock shot to $744, but has fallen to the $150 area. This 80% drop from highs looks like a bargain, but investors should watch the technical levels before feeling comfortable getting on the long side.\\n\\nThe 21- day MA is $220, while the 50-day $302 and the 200-day is $318. Those levels are likely going to come down over time so keep an eye on those long-term for an entry.\\n\\nBut for now, the stock just fell into a “Death Cross” which is when the 50-day falls below the 200-day. If there is further pressure on the market and RH, the COVID lows under $80 could be in play. So with that risk on the table, investors need to shy away.\\n\\nIn Summary\\n\\nWhile RH may eventually present a long-term value opportunity, the near-term outlook remains highly uncertain. Tariff volatility, falling earnings estimates, and technical weakness—highlighted by a recent death cross—paint a bearish picture for the stock in 2025.\\n\\nWith analysts slashing forecasts and macroeconomic headwinds mounting, investors are likely better off staying on the sidelines until clearer signs of stabilization emerge.\\n\\nAdditional content:\\n\\nWorried About Tariffs? Keep a Close Eye on These 2 Energy Stocks\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump’s recently imposed tariff has rattled the equity market. The question in everybody’s mind is whether the tariffs will be in place for an extended period. If the tariffs stick around for a while, U.S. spending across all businesses will probably take a hit in the face of increased prices. Eventually, there will be a contraction in the American economy. If there is a slowdown, then energy demand will go down, which could weigh heavily on the business performance of most energy companies.\\n\\nNow, these are still assumptions, and nobody is sure of what is going to happen, thereby fueling ambiguity. Amid the uncertain and turbulent energy business, should energy investors keep a close eye on energy giants like Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corporation?\\n\\nIntegrated Business Model & Strong Balance Sheet to the Rescue\\n\\nIntegrated energy companies are relatively less prone to uncertain business scenarios. This is because when their upstream business suffers from low oil prices, they can keep afloat by banking on their downstream operations. If these companies have strong balance sheets, they can confidently leverage their financial strength to avail loans during uncertain times at favorable rates, maintaining their operational stability even during turbulent times.\\n\\n2 Must-Watch Energy Majors: CVX, XOM\\n\\nChevron\\n\\nChevron, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is among the integrated energy giants with a presence in both the upstream and downstream energy spaces. In the low-cost Permian – the most prolific basin in the United States – CVX has a strong footprint, which will likely aid the company’s production growth in the long run. Chevron’s capital discipline is also noteworthy, as this will pave the way for considerable cash flow generation. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nHowever, CVX can likely navigate the current energy market uncertainty with confidence, backed by its strong balance sheet and integrated business model. Chevron’s debt-to-capitalization is at 13.8%, considerably lower than the 29% of the composite stocks belonging to the industry.\\n\\nExxonMobil\\n\\nExxonMobil is the largest non-government integrated energy company in the world. In the prolific Permian and Guyana resources, XOM has a solid pipeline of profitable projects, securing a healthy production outlook.\\n\\nXOM with a Zacks Rank of 3 also has a strong balance sheet that it can rely on to sail through the current turbulent tariff-induced business environment. ExxonMobil’s debt-to-capitalization is 13.4%, which is also at a very low level and, hence, is significantly below the industry.\\n\\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\\n\\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.\\n\\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\\n\\nSee Stocks Free >>\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nZacks Investment Research\\n\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\n\\nhttps://www.zacks.com\\n\\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.
